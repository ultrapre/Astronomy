<p class="font49">Messier had no idea his first catalogued object would be among the most intriguing in the heavens. Ml, the Crab Nebula, is one of 100 or more&nbsp;known supernova remnants in our galaxy _ a corpse of a star that experienced a fast life and a violent death. A supernova explosion is the final&nbsp;stage in the life of a star some 15 times more massive than our sun. Such a&nbsp;<span class="font49" style="font-style:italic;">red supergiant</span><span class="font49"> star (like Betelgeuse, in the shoulder of Orion) voraciously&nbsp;consumes its nuclear fuel in about 10 million years (100 times faster than&nbsp;die sun). When the star's thermonuclear energy is exhausted, its earthsize core collapses under the force of gravity and, within seconds, shrinks&nbsp;until the core's density equals that of an atomic nucleus. Unable to contract further, infalling gas rebounds off the resistant core. A quartersecond later, the star ends its life in a fantastic explosion, the peak energy&nbsp;of which can rival that of its host galaxy</span></p>
<p class="font49">The Crab is the remains of a cataclysmic stellar explosion that occurred in our own Milky Way galaxy in A.D. 1054. So powerful and so&nbsp;close (approximately 6,500 light years) was the blast that Chinese skywatchers described it as a <sup>M</sup>guest star&quot; in the annals of the Sung dynasty. It&nbsp;shined as bright as Venus in the daytime sky, appeared reddish white, and&nbsp;was observed for 23 days.</p>
<p class="font49">As the only supernova remnant in Messiefs catalogue, Ml warrants special attention. In small telescopes it is a 6' x 4' irregular patch of nebu-losity situated a little more than 1° northwest of the 3rd-magnitude star&nbsp;Zeta (0 Tauri, a hot, blue subgiant star. The nebula is surprisingly easy to</p><div>

<p class="font49">see with 7X35 binoculars (amazing, if you consider that nearly two millennia have passed since the explosion). Curiously, most catalogues fail to provide a precise visual-magnitude estimate for this very famous object.&nbsp;In the <span class="font49" style="font-style:italic;">Messier Album,</span><span class="font49"> Mallas and Kreimer give it a magnitude of *'8 or 9&quot;;&nbsp;Burnham says &quot;about 9.&quot; Jones, in his work </span><span class="font49" style="font-style:italic;">Messier's Nebulae and Star&nbsp;Clusters,</span><span class="font49"> gives it a more precise magnitude, 8.4. All these estimates seem a&nbsp;trifle too faint.</span></p>
<p class="font49">At 23 x the Crab Nebula shares the field with Zeta Tauri, and the nebulous glow looks much like the ghost image of that star. But the nebula, which measures roughly 11 light years by 7% light years, is so much more&nbsp;enormous. It is composed of three parts: a 16th-magnitude pulsar (a&nbsp;rotating neutron star), an inner bubble of material (a powerful wind of&nbsp;radiating particles bound to the object's magnetic field), and an outer&nbsp;shell of dense material released in the supernova explosion.</p>
<p class="font49">With a glance at low power, the nebula's midsection appears pinched. A longer look will reveal two halves slightly askew or misaligned,&nbsp;as if two plates along a tectonic fault had suddenly slipped. At higher magnifications the nebula looks patchy with three distinct sections running&nbsp;southeast to northwest. The southern and middle sections are of similar&nbsp;brightness, while the northern one is smaller and much fainter. When&nbsp;photographed in polarized light, the nebula reveals a similar trilobate or&nbsp;serrated aspect, indicating the existence of very strong magnetic fields.&nbsp;Has anyone with a large telescope ever tried to view Ml with polarized&nbsp;glass, like the rotating polarizer used in terrestrial photography?</p>
<p class="font49">The Crab's eastern edge contains a prominent notch, or bay, accen-mated by a long filament flowing to the southeast. This filament mean-ders through the nebula's midsection to the western side, where it extends beyond the main body. Look carefully and see if you can detect a gray river&nbsp;adjoining the filament, which visually separates the southern and middle&nbsp;portions. An enhancement at the northern boundary of the southern&nbsp;section abuts the gray river. It looks like an elongated patch of nebulosity&nbsp;(running east to west) with a possible dual nature.</p>
<p class="font49">When I first saw this patch, I wondered if this might be the blended image of the Crab's rapidly spinning neutron star and its equally bright&nbsp;neighbor star. Alas, at magnitude 16, the neutron star (whose pulses of x-ray, optical, and radio energy every 0.033 second illuminate the nebulosity) i<sub>s</sub> too faint for such a small instrument. The enhancement, however, is&nbsp;jus<span class="font28">【</span><span class="font49">south of the Crab's true double heart. Interestingly, this patchy feature&nbsp;also shows well in polarized-light images.</span></p>
<p class="font49">I did view the neutron star through a 20-inch Dobsonian at the 1990 Winter Star Party in the Florida Keys. From the best sites, the pulsar can be&nbsp;seen in a 10-inch telescope with high-quality, unobstructed glass. That&nbsp;night in Florida I also noticed that the main nebulous body is surrounded&nbsp;by a fainter glow composed of a network of fine filaments. Rosse first&nbsp;noted the Crab's filamentary structure in 1844. And though it is commonly&nbsp;stated that large telescopes are needed to bring out these delicate features, they can be glimpsed in a 4-inch glass. The problem is not one of&nbsp;aperture but of sky background and contrast.</p>
<p class="font49">Data from Hubble Space Telescope observations of the Crab Nebula in 1994 reveal that these Aliments are cloaked in a glowing&nbsp;plasma. In a paper published in the 1 January 1996 issue of the&nbsp;<span class="font49" style="font-style:italic;">Astrophysical Journal</span><span class="font49"> J. Jeff Hester (Arizona State Unversity) and his&nbsp;team suggested that the glowing filaments develop where fast-moving&nbsp;plasma from the Crab's inner bubble of material pushes on the dense&nbsp;outer shell. HST data also show regions of magnetic instability, where&nbsp;fingers of plasma pour back into the inner bubble as it pushes outward.&nbsp;Some astronomers have suggested that there is also an invisible element&nbsp;to Ml - more material beyond the Crab's visible extent - through which&nbsp;this inner bubble is expanding. The bubble, then, might be sweeping up&nbsp;this unseen material and channeling it into the visible, fingerlike struc-</span><span class="font28">【</span><span class="font49">ures resolved by HST. If so, this finger formation in the Aliments is an&nbsp;ongoing process.</span></p>
<p class="font49">Finally, have you ever wondered how Ml derived its nickname, &quot;the Crab&quot;? Jones explained that the name stems from a drawing made in 1844&nbsp;based on observations with the 36-inch Rosse reflector at Birr Castle in&nbsp;Ireland. The drawing bears some resemblance to a horseshoe crab,&nbsp;though, as Jones pointed out, it really looks more like a pineapple. Rosse&nbsp;virtually repudiated that sketch, yet the moniker remains. Interestingly, i<sub>n&nbsp;</sub>the 4-inch the nebula's main body looks very much like a crab or lobster&nbsp;claw, so I derive some pleasure in having found a way to preserve this&nbsp;intriguing historical interpretation.</p><div>

<p><span class="font48" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">messier: [Observed 11 September 1760J Nebula&nbsp;without a star in the head of&nbsp;Aquarius. The center is bright,&nbsp;surrounded by circular&nbsp;luminosity; it resembles the&nbsp;beautiful nebula that lies&nbsp;between the bow and the&nbsp;head of Sagittarius. It is clearly&nbsp;visible with a two-foot&nbsp;telescope, set on the same&nbsp;parallel as a Aquarii. M.&nbsp;Messier plotted it on the chart&nbsp;showing the path of the comet&nbsp;observed in 1759, </span><span class="font48" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">M^moires&nbsp;de VAcad^mie 1760,</span><span class="font48" style="font-weight:bold;"> page 464.&nbsp;M. Maraldi saw this nebula in&nbsp;1746, while observing the&nbsp;comet that appeared in that&nbsp;year.</span></p></div><br clear="all"><div><img src="Deep-sky companions the Messier objects by Stephen James OMeara (z-lib_files/Deep-sky companions the Messier objects by Stephen James OMeara (z-lib-25.jpg" style="width:245pt;height:168pt;"/></div><br clear="all">
<p class="font49">In autumn, the vast summer Milky Way slips drowsily into the western horizon after sundown. Hours will pass before mighty Orion and other&nbsp;bright winter constellations rise in the east. Looking overhead, we now&nbsp;peer straight out of the galaxy- away from the crowded stellar cities of the&nbsp;Milky Way's arms - into a suburb of stars whose residents include some of&nbsp;the most inconspicuous constellations in the night sky; chief among them&nbsp;Aquarius, the Water Bearer. It is largely indefinable, and its faint stars must&nbsp;compete with light pollution. Nevertheless, Aquarius contains a secret&nbsp;treasure well worth hunting for - the spectacular globular cluster M2.</p>
<p class="font49">Like Ml, M2 was a chance discovery for Messier. He happened upon it while looking for a comet in 1760, but Jean-Dominique Maraldi II in&nbsp;Paris had noticed it 14 years earlier. Maraldi suspected this nebulous&nbsp;object was a cluster, but his reasoning was clearly hypothetical: since <span class="font49" style="font-style:italic;">he&nbsp;</span><span class="font49">could not detect any field stars surrounding this unresolvable haze,</span><span class="font28">【</span><span class="font49">he&nbsp;haze itself, he deduced, must be made of innumerable stars too faint to be&nbsp;seen.</span></p>
<p class="font49">The popular nineteenth-century British observer Adm. William Henry Smyth seemed especially fond of M2: &quot;This magnificent ball of&nbsp;stars condenses to the centre and presents so fine a spherical form that&nbsp;imagination cannot but picture the inconceivable brilliance of their&nbsp;visible heavens to its animated myriads/* Although Smyth's words are a&nbsp;Hide hard to follow, il's clear that he was thoroughly impressed.</p><div>
<p><span class="font48" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">ngc: Very remarkable globular cluster, bright, very&nbsp;large, gradually pretty much&nbsp;brighter toward the middle,&nbsp;well resolved into extremely&nbsp;faint stars.</span></p></div><br clear="all">
<p class="font49">To find M2 without setting circles or automatic devices, you need a proper knowledge of the constellations, because the cluster lies in a&nbsp;<sub>re</sub>gion relatively barren of stars. It's easiest to first locate 2.4-magnitude&nbsp;Epsilon (e) Pegasi (the nose of the mythical winged horse, Pegasus) and&nbsp;3.9-magnicude Alpha (a) Equulei, nearly a fist width to the southwest.&nbsp;From the midpoint between Alpha Equulei and Epsilon Pegasi, look about&nbsp;5<span class="font28">。</span><span class="font49">co the southeast and you'll find three 6th-magnitude stars - 25,26, and&nbsp;27 Aquarii. Just south of 25 and 26 Aquarii, a string of binocular stars&nbsp;become increasingly bright to the southwest. Follow them because they&nbsp;point directly to M2. This 6th-magnitude cluster stands out prominently&nbsp;as a round, hazy patch in binoculars. It can also be seen, without too much&nbsp;difficulty, with the unaided eye, although you may have to use averted&nbsp;vision.</span></p>
<p class="font49">Except for a lOth-magnitude star about 5' to its northeast, M2 appears rather lonely at low power. The globular lies far from the plane of&nbsp;(he Milky Way, so its telescopic surroundings appear relatively devoid of&nbsp;bright background stars. But the visual impact of the cluster itself makes&nbsp;up for that deficiency. At 23 x this 170-light-year-wide swarm of 100,000&nbsp;suns - replete with yellow and red-giant stars about 13 billion years old -displays a very tight, starlike center surrounded by a yellow outer core that&nbsp;has a diffuse, pale-blue halo. The 7-mm eyepiece resolves a sprinkling of&nbsp;stars, the brightest of which are about 13th magnitude. But add a Barlow&nbsp;lens and, with averted vision, the dotted haze becomes a multitude of&nbsp;faintly sparkling gems. The strong illusion of a central star at low power&nbsp;vanishes with moderate to high magnifications, when the globular is&nbsp;transformed into a mysterious ball of starlight and shadows.</p><div><img src="Deep-sky companions the Messier objects by Stephen James OMeara (z-lib_files/Deep-sky companions the Messier objects by Stephen James OMeara (z-lib-26.jpg" style="width:169pt;height:133pt;"/></div><br clear="all"><div>
<p class="font49">If you can let your gaze alight a moment on the individual shadows, the illusion of M2's spherical nature will be shattered. The outer envelope&nbsp;takes on a peculiar north-south asymmetry with an explosion of starlight&nbsp;at its fringes. Now the mystery shadows seem to blow out from the center&nbsp;with the star streams, forming spidery arms. One particularly obvious,&nbsp;rogue shadow has been noted by several observers. It slices through the&nbsp;northeast section of the outer halo and runs northwest to southeast. The&nbsp;neighboring lOth-magnitude star is a perfect guide, because the shadow&nbsp;lies roughly halfway between it and the cluster's center.</p>
<p class="font49">Look at M2 several times over the course of two weeks, because it contains a prominent variable star, which can greatly impact the cluster s&nbsp;appearance. A French amateur astronomer named A. Chfevremont discovered this pulsating star in 1897. Located on the eastern edge of the&nbsp;cluster, just slightly north of center, Chlvremont's variable ranges in&nbsp;brightness from magnitude 12.5 to 14.0 over about 11 days (that period&nbsp;may fluctuate). At maximum, ChQvremont's variable should be within&nbsp;range of a good 2-inch telescope.</p><div><img src="Deep-sky companions the Messier objects by Stephen James OMeara (z-lib_files/Deep-sky companions the Messier objects by Stephen James OMeara (z-lib-27.jpg" style="width:245pt;height:246pt;"/></div><br clear="all"><div><img src="Deep-sky companions the Messier objects by Stephen James OMeara (z-lib_files/Deep-sky companions the Messier objects by Stephen James OMeara (z-lib-28.jpg" style="width:31pt;height:16pt;"/></div><br clear="all">
<p class="font49">M3 is another challenging object for beginners. Not only is it a great naked-eye challenge, but, as discussed in chapter 3» the stars in the cluster&nbsp;itself can be used to test telescopic vision (see the chart on page 33).&nbsp;Although it is located in Canes Venalici. it's best to use the stars of Bootes&nbsp;and Coma Berenices as guides. M3 is just northeast of an orange 6th-mag-nitude star about two finger-widths due east of Beta (R) Comae Berenices&nbsp;and 10° (one fist) north and slightly west of Eta (q) Bootis. Once located in&nbsp;binoculars, this cluster is easier to see with the naked eye than M2 for&nbsp;several reasons: it is a half-magnitude brighter, there is a 6th-magnitude&nbsp;guide star next to it, and it resides much higher in the northern hemisphere sky. Here*s the catch: M3 lies so close to the guide star it may be&nbsp;hard to resolve the two! Both Skiff and I achieved this from the dark skies&nbsp;of Texas, and I have no difficulty seeing M3 with the unaided eye from&nbsp;Hawaii.</p>
<p class="font49">Although M3 lies in a relatively star-poor field,<span class="font28">让 </span><span class="font49">is contained in an acute triangle of9th-magnitude stars, and an obvious topaz star borders&nbsp;the cluster to its northwest. With a glance using 23x, the 19<sup>r</sup>-wide glow&nbsp;displays a stellarlike core surrounded by a gradually fading halo. But look</span></p><div>

<p><span class="font48" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">messier: (Observed3May 1764) Nebula discovered&nbsp;between Bodtes and one of&nbsp;Hevelius's Hunting Dogs&nbsp;ICanesVenatici). It does not&nbsp;contain any stars, the center is&nbsp;bright, and its light decreases&nbsp;imperceptibly [away from the&nbsp;center); it is circular. Under a&nbsp;good sky it can be seen with a&nbsp;one-foot telescope. It is&nbsp;plotted on the chart of the&nbsp;comet observed in 1779,&nbsp;</span><span class="font48" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">M^moiresde VAcad^mie</span><span class="font48" style="font-weight:bold;"> for&nbsp;(hat year. Observed again&nbsp;29 March 1781, still as fine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font48" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">ngc: A very remarkable globular: extremely bright&nbsp;and very large; toward the&nbsp;middle it brightens suddenly;&nbsp;it contains stars which are&nbsp;11th magnitude and fainter.</span></p></div><br clear="all"><img src="Deep-sky companions the Messier objects by Stephen James OMeara (z-lib_files/Deep-sky companions the Messier objects by Stephen James OMeara (z-lib-29.jpg" style="width:349pt;height:134pt;"/>
<p class="font49">closely at the bright central point, because it appears bounded by a very tight inner shell with a distinct <span class="font49" style="font-style:italic;">peach</span><span class="font49"> colo</span><span class="font28">匚</span><span class="font49">(I have noticed that when (he&nbsp;cluster is low in the sky, this inner region looks yellow.)</span></p>
<p class="font49">The observed color of giobulars is open for debate. Some astronomers argue that the colors are merely optical illusions. But I find&nbsp;that at very low magnifications most bright giobulars show distinct, albeit&nbsp;<span class="font49" style="font-style:italic;">faint,</span><span class="font49"> colors - mostly shades of yellow and blue. Other observers have&nbsp;independently seen these tints, and true-color images of giobulars reveal&nbsp;them as well. Admittedly, green tints, which some giobulars appear to&nbsp;have, may be illusory, being a combination of the yellow and blue casts.&nbsp;Not surprisingly; I have also found that the blue and green colors of globu-lars seem to vanish with notable increases in magnification.</span></p>
<p class="font49">Continuing at low power, M3's peach-tinted inner shell is framed by a larger and fainter mantle, which shines weakly with an aqua luster&nbsp;(more greenish with some blue). Beyond this is an even larger envelope,&nbsp;whose overall color is blue-green. M3 should certainly be rated as one of&nbsp;the most colorful giobulars for small telescopes in the Northern&nbsp;Hemisphere. At the least, its color scheme is intriguing and apparent</p>
<p class="font49">At 72 x the cluster metamorphoses into a finely resolved sphere wi(h an uncanny three-dimensional quality; I feel like I'm looking down on a&nbsp;snowball melting on black ice. The cluster's core appears bulbous and its&nbsp;edges flat and sprawling. Moderate power also reveals a tantalizing string&nbsp;of stars that connects the cluster to the topaz star about 10* to the northwest. When seen in a simple inverted telescope, M3 seems to dangle from&nbsp;the star like an earring.</p>
<p class="font49">Some observers, such as the late Wai ter Scott Houston - whose Deep Sky Wonders column in <span class="font49" style="font-style:italic;">Sky &amp; Telescope</span><span class="font49"> magazine gave my generation of&nbsp;observers constant food for thought - have noticed that the central region&nbsp;is skewed to the west. I too see this, but believe it to be an illusion caused&nbsp;by a curious gathering of stellar clumps west of the cluster's true center. A&nbsp;series of westward-extending arms adds to this illusion. Otherwise,&nbsp;median</span><span class="font28">】 </span><span class="font49">and high powers resolve the cluster into a myriad of ultrafine&nbsp;stars, like tiny emerald chips scattered on a golden carpet. So uniform and&nbsp;gauzelike is the light from each individual star enveloping the bright core&nbsp;</span><span class="font30">(</span><span class="font49">ha</span><span class="font30">(</span><span class="font49"> 1 imagine it as a candle burning behind a curtain of green lace.</span></p>
<p class="font49">A good project for someone with a large telescope and a photometer might be to periodically check the brightness of stars in M3. Of the half-million suns shining in this venerable cluster, more than 180 are known to&nbsp;be variable. (For comparison, M2 has about 20 known variable stars.)</p>
<p class="font49">Visual observers should look for the mysterious dark spots that</p>
<p class="font49">inhabit M3<sup>F</sup>s nuclear region.

<p class="font49">Although brighter than either M2 or M3, M4 lies so close to the brilliant red supergiant Antares &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the west) in Scorpius that glare from</p>
<p class="font49">the lst-magnitude beacon all but ruins a clear and consistent naked-eve view of it. With binoculars, the cluster appears very bright and round.&nbsp;Telescopically, at low power the 35’ disk ofM4 immediately resolves into a&nbsp;loose throng of llth-magnitude stars, which betrays the cluster's overall&nbsp;roundness and symmetry; bisecting this sphere is a spindle of about a&nbsp;dozen 10th- to 12th-magnitude stars running north to south. With&nbsp;medium power this ridge appears more obvious and elongated. Here is a&nbsp;cat's keen eye, with its slit of a pupil, peering at you through the dark&nbsp;vapors of night. Although the Cat's Eye moniker is my own (which should&nbsp;not be confused with NGC 6543, the Cat's Eye Nebula» an 8th-magnitude&nbsp;planetary), I was by no means the first to see the &quot;pupil&quot; feature. William&nbsp;Herschel, discoverer of Uranus, described M4 in 1783 as a &quot;ridge of8or 10&nbsp;pretty bright stars,&quot; and Smyth saw it &quot;running up to a blaze in the centre?</p>
<p class="font49">Behind that stunning slit of starlight is a swollen haze of unresolved cluster members. Just when I feel I can resolve a faint member, that&nbsp;moment passes and I catch sight of another &quot;spark,&quot; until my eye spies&nbsp;another, and so on. One can spend hours being hypnotized by the&nbsp;comings and goings of these fleeting flashes. Burnham had a similar&nbsp;impression ofM4 after he observed the cluster through the Yerkes 40-incli&nbsp;refractor. He writes:</p>
<p class="font49">It happened that a few days before, I had obtained a small but fascinating device called a spinthariscope in which the effect of&nbsp;radioactivity is made visible to the eye; ever since I have mentally&nbsp;associated M4 with alpha particles.... The observer, after a period&nbsp;of dark adaptation, looks into the lens (of the spinthariscope] to see&nbsp;a view resembling M4 &quot;brought to life&quot; with hundreds of&nbsp;microscopic &quot;stars&quot; blazing up and vanishing every second.</p>
<p class="font49">Shock waves of dark lanes radiate from the needlelike hub. Defocus the telescope slightly to follow these dark ripples. So many populate the&nbsp;region chat with some imagination you can envision a shattered glass&nbsp;photographic plate of M4, or a cobweb silhouetted against an approaching swarm of lightning bugs, or, better yet, diamonds snatched up in a&nbsp;loose black net, with many leaking through the fibers into limitless space.</p>
<p class="font49">The outlying northern section appears to sink gradually into a black ocean, and if you look hard enough, you can perceive a submerged shoal&nbsp;of faint stars, a celestial reef. Many of the stars outside the core form concentric horseshoe-shaped patterns that loop northward from the south.&nbsp;Stellar arms fly off in various directions. In this way, the cluster looks more&nbsp;like a collision of two pinwheel galaxies such as M33 or M100, with flat,&nbsp;broad, and loose spiral arms.</p>
<p class="font49">While in the area, check out the tiny 9th-magnilude globular cluster NGC 6144 just <span class="font28">汾 </span><span class="font49">northwest of Antares. Its feeble glow reminds me of a&nbsp;ghost image of Sigma Scorpii, a hot blue-giant (Bl) star that shines at 3rd&nbsp;magnitude. NGC 6144 is a highly neglected object, hidden in the glare of&nbsp;Antares and overshadowed by M4.</span></p><div>

<p class="font49">The fifth object in Messier's catalogue is a powerful and dynamic sight tn small telescopes. Even at low power it is a slightly stellar conflagration with&nbsp;a blazing heart. A wide and loose, slightly elliptical exterior becomes&nbsp;increasingly tight toward a starlike center. The clusterlooks as ifit iscollap$^&nbsp;ing under the force of gravity, triggering atomic reactions in its core* And&nbsp;with a 7-mm, the entire cluster seems electric, burstingwith fiery sparks.</p>
<p class="font49">Now, contrast that with Mary Procior's musings on the same globular, which she viewed through the world's largest refractor, the 40-inch Clark at Yerkes Observatory. The description is from her 1924 book&nbsp;<span class="font49" style="font-style:italic;">Evenings With the Stars:</span><span class="font49"> &quot;Myriads of glistening points shimmering over a&nbsp;soft background of starry mist, illumined as though by moonlight....

<p class="font49">suggested a veritable glimpse of the heavens beyond.&quot; Observing is indeed a highly personal experience; sometimes we see what we feel.</p>
<p class="font49">To find this easy naked-eye object, Iook20<sup>#</sup> northwest of the fine double star 5 Serpentis (a golden 5th-magnitude star with a lOth-magnitude ashen&nbsp;companion a little more than 2' away). Color-namely, a straw interior with a&nbsp;powder blue exterior-is immediately obvious in M5. Few accounts I've seen&nbsp;mention the obvious curved wings of 12th-magnitude stars stretching&nbsp;northeast to south from the core. This region reminds me of an airborne owl,&nbsp;whose feathered wings shimmer with reflected light. At medium power, the&nbsp;wings are amazingly well defined. Luginbuhl and Skiff had a different&nbsp;impression, one of a &quot;rich open cluster superposed on a bright galaxy.&quot;</p>
<p class="font49">At 130 x, the nuclear region appears brightest to the north, with a faint stubby wing just to its west. Toward the southeast, stars spiral or fan&nbsp;out in long arms - a pattern Rosse noticed in 1875. These features seem to&nbsp;originate from stellar kinks along a central bar, the kinks themselves being&nbsp;chance associations of stars.</p>
<p class="font49">As you gaze at this incredible, 13-billion-year-old object - without question the finest globular cluster in the northern sky for small telescopes-try contemplating the following. M5 is superposed on the edge of&nbsp;a faint, distant cloud of galaxies, which is composed of several groups of&nbsp;galaxies <span class="font28">一 </span><span class="font49">a mind-boggling aggregate with some 200 members per square&nbsp;degree. Four degrees (about two finger-widths) due west of M5, at least&nbsp;eight galaxies surround the 4th-magnitude star 110 Virginis (not shown on&nbsp;the finder chart). All are visible at low power, but they are best seen at&nbsp;moderate magnifications. Take your time studying this region and&nbsp;confirm (he galaxies on your star atlas.</span></p>

<p class="font49">Located about 4° northeast of the blue subgiant star Lambda (X) Scorpii, the easternmost of the Scorpion's two stinger stars, are M6 and M7, two of&nbsp;the most striking details in the most dramatic naked-eye expanse in the&nbsp;heavens - the hub of our galaxy. These clusters are among the more brilliant Messier objects in the night sky. (M7, the southernmost Messier</p><div>
<p class="font49">object, is arguably the brightest spot in the entire visual Milky Way.) They all but dominate the summer Milky Way and erupt like distant fireworks.&nbsp;From dark southerly locations, both M6 and M7 are visible to the naked&nbsp;eye as puffs of smoke even under full moonlight!</p></div><br clear="all">
<p class="font49">Personally, I cannot look upon one of these clusters without imme-diately trying to contrast it with the other. And though they are separated by 3/° of sky, I view them as a double cluster, fraternal twins. Actually, the&nbsp;<sub>tw0</sub> clusters are some 805 light years apart, but aren't we entitled to enjoy&nbsp;them as we please?</p>
<p class="font49">The fainter of the two, M6, is famous for its butterfly pattern, which looks more like a 1960s butterfly motif (the kind worn on bell-bottoms)&nbsp;than, say. a swallowtail, but nevertheless, the imagery is quite striking.

<p class="font49">light! This aspect is even more apparent in the 4-inch at 23x. In fact, when sweeping from M7 to M6,1 noticed that M7 lies in the fattest part of&nbsp;a bright wedge of Milky Way - a rich star cloud - that points to M6. Tiny&nbsp;M6 sits like an island off the glittering sand of this Milky Way beach. With&nbsp;your binoculars or your telescope at low power, look at the region immediately surrounding M6; you should see a wall of open clusters running&nbsp;from the northeast to the southwest, including NGC 6451, 6425, 6416,&nbsp;and 6404. A little south of west is another loose sprinkling of stars, NGC&nbsp;6383.</p>
<p class="font49">I am not sure why over the last few centuries more observers didn't sing praises about M7. In the seventeenth century, Giovanni Hodiera&nbsp;wrote merely, &quot;Counted 30 stars.&quot; An apparently unimpressed Lacaiiie&nbsp;described M7 from the Cape of Good Hope as a &quot;group of 15 or 20 stars&nbsp;very close together in a square.&quot; And in his 1864 catalogue, John Herschel&nbsp;characterized it as **a cluster, very bright, pretty rich, little compressed.<sup>0</sup></p>
<p class="font49">Perhaps most of the observations were made from temperate latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere. From the northern tropics and the Southern Hemisphere, there are few grander naked-eye sights than this&nbsp;magnificent stellar wonder. M7 blazes against the river of the Milky Way&nbsp;like the head of some great lost comet.</p>
<p class="font49">M6 is estimated to be 100 million years old; M7 is more than twice that age. Compared to the icy-hued stars of M6, those in M7 appear more&nbsp;golden, like sun-drenched hay. M7 has about 80 stars, all of which shine&nbsp;brighter than 10th magnitude, and a dozen of these are brighter than 7th&nbsp;magnitude. The challenge, then, is to resolve this cluster with the naked&nbsp;eye. Clearly half of these stars are 6th magnitude and should be discernible from suburban skies. If you live under a very dark sky, try during&nbsp;lhe quarter moon, which will diminish the cluster's background noise of&nbsp;fainter, unresolved stars. Another trick is to catch M7 in the morning or&nbsp;evening twilight when its light just starts to fade or emerge, respectivelv;</p>
<p class="font49">With binoculars M7 looks like a gem-studded cross inside a double halo of similarly bright stars. With imagination, it is possible to perceive&nbsp;the cross and the two haloes all appearing on different planes. Defocus&nbsp;the binoculars slightly and see if you can detect the black slash running&nbsp;along the western side of the cross's long axis. That dark wound in the&nbsp;Milky Way points to Barnard 287, a pond of dark matter due south of the&nbsp;cluster.</p>
<p class="font49">Telescopically, M7 resembles a cosmic flower opening in the morning mist of the Milky Way, the long axis of the cross being the flower^&nbsp;stamen, and the haloes its petals.

<p class="font49">Agnes M.

The channel is but a part of the lagoon, which is really a V-shaped&nbsp;body of darkness that embraces a bright island of nebulosity to the west&nbsp;and a curved &quot;sandbar&quot; of nebulosity to the east. If you look long and hard&nbsp;enough, you should actually see two lagoons: a &quot;deep&quot; and narrow inner&nbsp;one, and a wider, &quot;shallower,&quot; outer one.

<p class="font49">The dark channel is so prominent at low power that it must be the most dramatic example of dark nebulosity in any deep-sky object visible&nbsp;in small telescopes. The entire nebula appears to be caught between&nbsp;worlds of darkness and light. John Herschel described it as a &quot;collection of&nbsp;nebulous folds and matter surrounding and including a number of dark,&nbsp;oval vacancies.<sup>0</sup> Use moderate power and averted vision to see the dark&nbsp;nebulosity that cages the bright nebula.</p>

To the naked eye and&nbsp;in binoculars, the nebula and the staff of the crossbow constitute what I&nbsp;immediately recognize as M8, and this is what Messier saw. The NGC 6530&nbsp;designation applies to the stars in the eastern part of the bow. Concentrate&nbsp;on the position of NGC 6530 in the nebula and see if it doesn't seem to&nbsp;weigh down the southern part of the nebulosity. To me, it is a very incongruous sight. I remedy that illusion by creating another: I like to imagine&nbsp;that the stars of the crossbow and the cluster are foreground objects and&nbsp;ihat the nebulous matter is far behind them.</span></p>
<p class="font49">Reserve plenty of time to study the heart of M8, just 3' west-south-west of 9 Sagittarii. It is easily recognizable as a very dense region of nebulosity surrounding the star Herschel 36. With moderate magnification, the region shines with a dusky yellow or straw color. Its main features are two&nbsp;bright knots (southeast and northeast of Herschel 36) and a &quot;wishbone&quot; of&nbsp;dark lanes to the northwest. The bright knots, whose tapered ends join in&nbsp;<span class="font28">【</span><span class="font49">he middle, make up the famed &quot;hourglass&quot; nebula - a mysterious source&nbsp;of radio emission.

A&nbsp;curious knot of nebulosity appears isolated from the &quot;hourglass<sup>0</sup> to the&nbsp;north of Herschel 36, could it be part of (he &quot;hourglass&quot; separated by these&nbsp;dark twirling clouds?</span></p>
<p class="font49">Just to the north of this region you will encounter a long, diffuse swath of nebulosity that arcs over all these features. To the west, a faint&nbsp;nebulosity veils the 5th-magnitude <span class="font49" style="font-style:italic;">F5</span><span class="font49"> star 7 Sagittarii and its fainter&nbsp;neighbor further to the west; a dim bridge of cloud connects them to M8.</span></p>
<p class="font49">Photographs, such as the one at the opening for this object, reveal several tiny, round globules of dark matter known as Bok globules after the&nbsp;late Harvard University astronomer Bart Bok, who interpreted the mysterious dark nebulae, which were first recorded in photographs by turn-of-the-centu^ astronomer E. E. Barnard. These dense, obscuring clouds&nbsp;have diameters of about one-third of a light year and larger and are&nbsp;believed to be sites of star formation. Bok globules are similar to, but different from, the dense star-spawning nebulae called ^evaporating&nbsp;gaseous globules&quot; (EGGs) that the Hubble Space Telescope imaged in&nbsp;M16, a nebula and cluster in Serpens. Bok globules are about 50 times&nbsp;larger than EGGs, whose placental clouds of dust and gas are about the&nbsp;size of our solar system. Like the EGGs, Bok globules undergo photoevaporation, the process in which intense ultraviolet radiation from young,&nbsp;hot <span class="font49" style="font-style:italic;">O-</span><span class="font49"> and B-type stars blows away surrounding dust and gas, uncovering&nbsp;sites of star formation.</span></p>
<p class="font49">Bok globules and EGGs are too faint to be seen in small telescopes, but I did unknowingly record a <span class="font49" style="font-style:italic;">mock</span><span class="font49"> Bok globule. It is actually Barnard 88,&nbsp;a cometlike dark nebula in the northeast section of the outer cloud (see&nbsp;the photograph). Visually, it appeared as a notch or bay in that swirling&nbsp;swath ofbrightness. But when I compared the drawing to the photograph,&nbsp;I saw that the location of the notch matched that of Barnard's black&nbsp;“comet.”</span></p><div><img src="Deep-sky companions the Messier objects by Stephen James OMeara (z-lib_files/Deep-sky companions the Messier objects by Stephen James OMeara (z-lib-43.jpg" style="width:245pt;height:286pt;"/></div><br clear="all">

<p class="font49">As you hunt down the Messier objects, try to forget any preconceived notions you might have about their appearance. For example, it is easy to&nbsp;assume that all Messier globular clusters will at first appear as tight, fuzzy&nbsp;balls of starlight. But M9 is clearly an exception. It immediately looks different, as though someone has tried to erase it from the sky.</p>
<p class="font49">M9 glows about 3%° southeast of 2.5-magnitude Eta (q) Ophiuchi, which is nearly 15° (a fist- and two finger-widths) to the northeast of brilliant Aniares in Scorpius. With an angular diameterof IT. M9 appears as a&nbsp;tiny patch of light in binoculars. At 23 x it remains dwarfish and looks&nbsp;highly compressed. Its appearance is all the more paltry if you happen to&nbsp;lake in the more dazzling Ophiuchus giobulars MIO and M12 first.</p>
<p class="font49">Curious as to why M9 looks unusual, I swept the region at 23 x and was surprised to discover that M9 and its immediate surroundings are&nbsp;cloaked in a very impressive double dark nebula.

A larger cloud, whose shape reminds me of a dinosaur footprint (with the toes pointing to the&nbsp;east), encompasses both Barnard 64 and M9.1 wondered whether this&nbsp;gloomy apparition was the reason this globular looked so gray and dim.&nbsp;This may indeed be the case. M9 is one of the closest globulars to the&nbsp;center of our galaxy, and heavy absorption of the cluster's light by interstellar dust might dim its intensity by at least one magnitude.</p><img src="Deep-sky companions the Messier objects by Stephen James OMeara (z-lib_files/Deep-sky companions the Messier objects by Stephen James OMeara (z-lib-46.jpg" style="width:249pt;height:88pt;"/>

This triangle&nbsp;of globulars - M9, NGC 6342, and NGC 6356 - &quot;overlaps” a similar triangle&nbsp;of 6th-magnitude stars.</p><div><img src="Deep-sky companions the Messier objects by Stephen James OMeara (z-lib_files/Deep-sky companions the Messier objects by Stephen James OMeara (z-lib-47.jpg" style="width:242pt;height:272pt;"/></div><br clear="all">
<p class="font49">From dark skies, this 6.6-magnitude globular cluster in Ophiuchus is an easy binocular object and can be seen without too much difficulty with&nbsp;the unaided eye, especially because the 5th-magnitude star 30 Ophiuchi,&nbsp;an orange giant star of spectral type <span class="font49" style="font-style:italic;">K4</span><span class="font49"> III, is so close to it. Just stare at&nbsp;this star and your averted vision should pick up MIO.

<p class="font49">through the center of the cluster from northeast to southwest. Suddenly M10*s core looks like Saturn with its rings seen nearly edge on through a&nbsp;thick fog.</p>
<p class="font49">Moderate power shatters this illusion and creates another. Now the cluster is caged - a bail of energy inside a pyramid of 12th-magnilude stars&nbsp;that may or may not belong to the cluster (they*re at that discernible fringe&nbsp;in the 4-inch). This pyramid itself is enclosed in another, larger pyramid of&nbsp;stars. The cluster's center shines with a soft, uniform glow. When I use&nbsp;averted vision, the surrounding halo, which otherwise shimmers with a&nbsp;faint light, shoots sparks of starlight across that sheet of &quot;plasma.&quot; This is&nbsp;not a flamboyant sight but an elegant one. Its starlight is rather demure&nbsp;and does not vary much in intensity. Most components look like diamond&nbsp;dust. Indeed, the cluster starts to resolve at magnitude 14.7, a tantalizing&nbsp;threshold for moderate apertures under dark skips. Why am I not surprised that only three variable stars have been discovered in this cluster?&nbsp;Even its sluggish recessional velocity of 43 miles per second speaks of a&nbsp;certain stately galactic reserve.</p>
<p class="font49">Although 1 have noticed several dark patches in the cluster's outer halo, I did not notice, as Rosse did, that the &quot;upper&quot; one-sixth of the&nbsp;cluster is fainter than the rest. Does such a variation in brightness exist?&nbsp;What do you see?</p><div><img src="Deep-sky companions the Messier objects by Stephen James OMeara (z-lib_files/Deep-sky companions the Messier objects by Stephen James OMeara (z-lib-49.jpg" style="width:172pt;height:155pt;"/></div><br clear="all"><div>

<p class="font49">Mil isa small (13') but extremely rich open cluster, bristling with the light of at least 680 suns; of these about 400 shine brighter than 14th magnitude. The cluster measures about 20 light years in diameter and its core is&nbsp;very dense. If you lived at the center of Mil, you would see several&nbsp;hundred lst-magnilude stars in the sk% and possibly 40 or so with an&nbsp;apparent brightness ranging from 3 to 50 times the light of Sirius, a scenario Robert J. Trumplerof Lick Observatory calculated in 1932.</p>
<p class="font49">To find Mil, look not quite 2° southeast of 4th-magnitude Beta (0) Scuti. The cluster is visible to the naked eye as a fuzzy pellet of light&nbsp;flanked by<span class="font30">(</span><span class="font49">wo 6th-magnitude stars to its northwest. Through binoculars&nbsp;the view is almost as stunning as it is through a telescope. Mil sits in a&nbsp;notch in the north edge of the Great Scutum Star Cloud, the brightest&nbsp;stellar island outside the galactic center in Sagittarius. Barnard called this&nbsp;region the gem of the Milky Way.</span></p>
<p class="font49">At low power Mil is well resolved and displays a fluid fan of starlight streaming from an 8th-magnitude saffron star near the fan's apex.&nbsp;Although not a true cluster member, this brilliant sun is one of many&nbsp;yellow giant stars contained in this cluster, whose age is estimated to be&nbsp;some 500 million years.</p>
<p class="font49">When viewing the cluster at 23x, two scenes come to mind: an exploding party favor with countless flecks of confetti fleeing into space,&nbsp;or a volcanic vent blowing out incandescent gas and golden shards of&nbsp;molicn rock. Can you see Smyth's “flight of wild ducks<sup>0</sup> (hence the nickname Wild Duck Cluster) in thisV formation of stars? There is a pair of 9th-magnitude stars south of the eastern flock of ducks.

<p class="font49">and the saffron star is a wall of faint stars. At moderate power, the cluster s nuclear region appears highly fractured, which was also noticed by the&nbsp;nineteenth-century astronomer Heinrich d'Arrest, who described Mil as&nbsp;&quot;a magnificent pile of innumerable stars. Irregular and as if divided into&nbsp;several agglomerations.<sup>0</sup></p>
<p class="font49">Use high power to examine the cluster's dumbbell-shaped interior (see the accompanying drawing) and the waves of stars flowing away from&nbsp;it to the west. In fact, the outer fringes of the cluster are composed of wild&nbsp;stellar arcs that emanate from the clustefs northern extremes and curve&nbsp;southward. When I look with averted vision, I can see many faint streamers of stars at the limit of vision. With its triangular body, insectlike&nbsp;appendages, and tiny pointed northern &quot;head,&quot; M11 looks more like a tick&nbsp;than a flock of wild ducks. (Does the tick's head look fuzzy to you?) If you&nbsp;can view the cluster with north at the top of your field of view, use high&nbsp;power and relax your gaze, or slightly defocus the cluster. I can make out a&nbsp;Jolly Roger (a grinning skull complete with a black eye patch).</p>
<p class="font49">If you have a very wide-field telescope you must take the time to sweep the Great Scutum Star Cloud, where there is an incredible diversity&nbsp;of bright and dark nebulosity (of various shades of gray). A striking slash of&nbsp;darkness (Barnard 318) lies immediately south ofMll. South of B318 lies&nbsp;an eerily dark pond (Barnard 112). By the way, the notch in the northern&nbsp;edge of the Star Cloud (where Mil resides) is created by a massive swatch&nbsp;of darkness (Barnard 320).</p>
<p class="font49">One night in August 1995 when the sky was illuminated by the full moon I turned the world's second-largest refractor-the Lick Observaton&nbsp;36-inch on Mount Hamilton in California -to Mil and studied it at 588 x.&nbsp;The field of view was five times smaller than the cluster, so I had to electrically slew the telescope north and south, east and west, to see the entire&nbsp;cluster. While slewing west of the bright saffron star, a blizzard of faint&nbsp;starlight filled the field. Slewing further west, the view suddenly began to&nbsp;grow dim. I looked up to see if clouds had moved in. but the moon and&nbsp;stars were tack sharp against the velvet sky. Returning to the eyepiece I&nbsp;realized it was dark galactic vapors that had dimmed the starlight. I&nbsp;reversed the slewing direction and started over. This time I slowly&nbsp;“walked&quot; across glistening moonlit fields, wet with starlight, until I gradually sank into that misty moor beyond them.</p>
<p class="font49">Just 1° northwest of Mil is a famous naked-eye variable, R Scuti, whose semiregular pulsations (from 4.8 to 6.0 magnitude) repeat about&nbsp;every 143 days. The star occasionally dips below naked-eye visibility.</p>
<p class="font49">Here's an interesting note: On 25 June 1995, while viewing Mil with 72x, I wrote in my notebook &quot;very red star nearby.&quot; But I didn't indicate&nbsp;exactly where. Can you locate it? Is it a variable?</p><div><img src="Deep-sky companions the Messier objects by Stephen James OMeara (z-lib_files/Deep-sky companions the Messier objects by Stephen James OMeara (z-lib-51.jpg" style="width:244pt;height:168pt;"/></div><br clear="all"><div>

<p class="font49">M13 is generally considered the finest globular cluster in the northern skies, mainly because it is visible to the naked eye in a well-known grouping of stars that sails high overhead in the summer sky. It is a swollen mass&nbsp;teeming with perhaps 300,000 to a half-million suns spread across 140&nbsp;light years or more; a typical globular contains tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of stars. A relatively close globular (about the same&nbsp;distance of M5), the Great Hercules Cluster is pleasingly bright.

<p class="font49">At moderate power this 14-billion-year-old cluster shows only a handful of seemingly bright members shining between 11th and 12th&nbsp;magnitude, though about two dozen 13th-magnitude stars sparkle into&nbsp;view across the cluster's face. The remainder form a barely resolvable&nbsp;haze, like finely crushed sandstone illuminated by a setting sun. Indeed,&nbsp;at times, I swear the center has a bloodlike tinge. This is not too difticuit io&nbsp;believe, because the cluster's brightest members are red giants. At first,&nbsp;the core appears moderately diffuse, but if you stare long enough, you&nbsp;might see a gradual brightening toward the center.</p>
<p class="font49">M13 really packs a punch at high power! With averted vision the view is almost frightening - a blazing ball of tiny suns. So many more stars, so&nbsp;many more patterns to consider. Arcs of stars to the northeast create an&nbsp;impression ofa strong galactic wind blowing from that direction, forming&nbsp;a bow shock on that side ofM13. And the forked array of stars to the southwest forms a beautiful cock's-tail wake. Look carefully at the cluster's core;&nbsp;it is fractured, with a definite asymmetry toward the south. Here you can&nbsp;also see many dark patches and rifts. Only once did I recognize Rosses&nbsp;classic darkY shape, just southeast of the core, and, surprisingly, that was&nbsp;on a foggy night! I have yet to see it again in the 4-inch, despite having&nbsp;made several attempts to look solely for that feature. Interestingly, I discovered my own Y in the northwest halo, just inside the northern wing, as&nbsp;shown in the drawing. Furthermore, this darkY shows nicely on a photographic plate made with the Lowell Observatory's 13-inch telescope.</p>
<p class="font49">M13 is an impressive cluster, but I think its grandeur is slightly overrated for sma//-telescope users. It certainly is a magnificent cluster in photographs and when seen through large-aperture telescopes. But is it the <span class="font49" style="font-style:italic;">finest</span><span class="font49"> globular cluster in the northern skies for small apertures? The&nbsp;answer, in my opinion, is no. In a 4-inch refractor, M13 does not have as&nbsp;<sub>strO</sub>ng a visual impact as M5. To achieve truly outstanding resolution of&nbsp;M13 in a 4-inch telescope, one really needs high magnification and keen&nbsp;averted vision. The globular M5, on the other hand, immediately displays&nbsp;<sub>an</sub> assortment of stellar magnitudes, color, and star patterns at only 23 x.&nbsp;Furthermore, M5 is, according to my magnitude estimate, only 0.4 magnitude fainter than M13. (However, </span><span class="font49" style="font-style:italic;">Sky Catalogue 2000.0</span><span class="font49"> claims M5 is magnitude 5.75 and M13is magnitude 5.86!)</span></p>
<p class="font49">Before leaving M13, don't forget to try for the llth-magnitude spiral galaxy NGC 6207 about 40* to the northeast. The Genesis at medium&nbsp;power shows it as an obvious elongated haze. These two objects provide a&nbsp;dramatic example of depth of ©eld: NGC 6207 lies at a distance of 46&nbsp;million light years - about 2,000 times farther than M13in the halo of our&nbsp;own galaxy.</p><img src="Deep-sky companions the Messier objects by Stephen James OMeara (z-lib_files/Deep-sky companions the Messier objects by Stephen James OMeara (z-lib-55.jpg" style="width:246pt;height:147pt;"/>

<p class="font49">l<sup>;</sup>or the same reasons that M13 is popular, globular cluster M14 is not. It is beyond the normal naked-eye limit and lies in a region of sky belonging to&nbsp;an obscure constellation that never gets very high in the sky from midnorthern latitudes. Yet M14 is surprisingly detailed and deserves special&nbsp;attention.</p>
<p class="font49">To find ii, first locate 3rd-magnitude Beta<span class="font30">(</span><span class="font49">B</span><span class="font30">)</span><span class="font49">Ophiuchi. Ten degrees (one fist-width) to the southwest is 4.5-magnitude 47 Ophiuchi, the&nbsp;brightest star in that region. M14 is just over 3° to the northeast and is&nbsp;visible in binoculars.</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font48" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">messier: lObserved 1 June 1764J Nebula without a star,&nbsp;discovered in the drapery that&nbsp;hangs from the right arm of&nbsp;Ophiuchus, and lying on the&nbsp;parallel of C Serpentis. This&nbsp;nebula is not large, and its&nbsp;luminosity is feeble: however,&nbsp;it may be seen with a simple&nbsp;three-and-a-half-foot&nbsp;refractor; it is circular. Close&nbsp;to it is a faint star of the ninth&nbsp;magnitude. Its position has&nbsp;been determined relative to -y&nbsp;Ophiuchi, and M. Messier&nbsp;plotted its position on the&nbsp;chart for the comet ofl 769,&nbsp;</span><span class="font48" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">M^moiresde I'Acad^mie 1775,&nbsp;</span><span class="font48" style="font-weight:bold;">plate DC Observed again 22&nbsp;March 1781.</span></p>
<p><span class="font48" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">ngc: Remarkable globular, bright, very large, round,&nbsp;extremely rich, very gradually&nbsp;becoming brighter toward its&nbsp;center, well resolved, 15th-magnitude stars.</span></p></div><br clear="all">
<p class="font49">At low power in the telescope this diminutive globular looks as lonely as it does in binoculars. The field is so sparse that the globular&nbsp;appears dim and distant in the void. This is another dusty region of the&nbsp;Milky Way, which coniributes to light loss from the globular. But unlike&nbsp;M9, which looks gloomy, M14 shares none of that pallor. In fact, I find i<span class="font30">(</span><span class="font49">&nbsp;quite luminous, like a comet with a diffuse inner coma surrounded by a&nbsp;diffuse outer coma. Overall the cluster has a pale straw color. Although&nbsp;there was not even a hint of resolution at low power, I noticed that what a</span><span class="font30">(</span><span class="font49">&nbsp;first appeared to be a circular glow actually had a curved section of hazy&nbsp;light cutting north to south through the tiny faint nuclear region. It also&nbsp;has a quite extensive halo, which was diminished greatly one night under&nbsp;high, thin clouds, so I wondered how city lights must affect this delicate&nbsp;object. Indeed, though M14 is catalogued as having a diameter of 11\&nbsp;some popular references list a diameter as small as 3'.</span></p>
<p class="font49">The cluster starts to reveal itself at moderate power, when at first glance the center appears as a bulging mass, a cracking shell of starlight.&nbsp;Even the outer halo, which is is bracketed by two roughly 12th-magnitude&nbsp;stars, can be partially resolved. The cluster now bursts with faint starlight.&nbsp;That hazy north-south curve reveals patches of nicely resolved stars, like&nbsp;star-forming regions in the arms of a spiral galaxy About seven distinct&nbsp;arms extend in various directions.</p>
<p class="font49">The cluster's center is loose enough to start resolving at moderate power, and how nice it is to see colorfully bright stars against the core.&nbsp;Higher power immediately produces a most interesting sight: a tiny stellar&nbsp;core emerges, tangerine in color. Perhaps ii is the &quot;faint sparkle* noted by&nbsp;Luginbuhl and Skiff in their <span class="font49" style="font-style:italic;">Observing Handbook and Catalogue of Deep-Sky Objects.</span><span class="font49"> The rest of the nucleus is a jumble of bright chunks of&nbsp;starlight, whose north and south edges are slightly swollen, giving that&nbsp;region a slight dumbbell shape. Perhaps the spaces between these chunks&nbsp;are what astrophotographer Isaac Roberts alluded to when he saw **vacan-cics in the centre&quot; of the object on his glass plates.</span></p><div><img src="Deep-sky companions the Messier objects by Stephen James OMeara (z-lib_files/Deep-sky companions the Messier objects by Stephen James OMeara (z-lib-56.jpg" style="width:173pt;height:132pt;"/></div><br clear="all"><div>

<p><span class="font48" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">ngc: Remarkable cluster, very large and bright,&nbsp;irregularly round, very&nbsp;suddenly much brighter in&nbsp;the middle, well resolved into&nbsp;very small [faint] stars.</span></p></div><br clear="all">
<p class="font49">Nearly a twin of M2 in Aquarius, this glittering gem in the winged horse, Pegasus, is one of six beautiful globulars brighter than 7th magnitude that&nbsp;grace the northern sky (the others are M2, M3, M5, M13, and M92). The&nbsp;Great Pegasus Cluster, M15, can be spotted without difficulty as a &quot;fuzzy&nbsp;star&quot; with the unaided eye, lying just 4° northwest of the topaz (lype-/C21)&nbsp;2nd-magnitude star Epsilon (e) Pegasi. M15 is some 30,000 light years&nbsp;distant (16,600 light years farther away than M13) and measures up to 160&nbsp;light years in diameter. Like M13, it contains many red-giant stars. But&nbsp;because of its greater distance, M15 appears fainter and more compact&nbsp;than M13.</p>
<p class="font49">At low power the cluster hides inside a triangle of three 7th- to 8th-magnitude stars. Hazy, spiderlike arms are already apparent, and the cluster brightens rapidly toward the center. Otherwise, like M13, most&nbsp;of M15<sup>F</sup>s stars evade direct gaze and require averted vision. William&nbsp;Herschel rated this a good test object for resolution. But subtle details&nbsp;do show through. For example, it has a definite asymmetry. The late&nbsp;Harvard University astronomer Harlow Shapley first confirmed this by&nbsp;noting the oblateness at the cluster's central bulge, which is surrounded&nbsp;by a spherical shell of stars. M15 also displays dark patches. One&nbsp;obvious dark feature appears next to a detached string of stars on the&nbsp;northeast edge of the cluster's inner shell. Another, tighter arc of stars to&nbsp;the east of the nucleus makes the entire central region appear warped&nbsp;in that direction, something noticed by d*Arrest in the nineteenth&nbsp;century.</p>
<p class="font49">According to Webb, &quot;Buffham, with a 9-inch (mirror] finds a dark patch near the middle with two faint, dark lines or rifts like those in M13.&quot;&nbsp;I did not notice these. My view is more like the one Isaac Roberts&nbsp;described at the turn of the century, in which stars are arranged &quot;in curves,&nbsp;lines and patterns.&quot;</p>
<p class="font49">The cluster has an unusual resident, a 14th-magnitude planetary nebula, Pease 1, on its northeast side. In fact, M15 is one of two globular&nbsp;clusters known to contain a planetary; the other is a 10&quot;x 7&quot; object, GJJC-1, in M22. E G. Pease discovered the M15 planetary in 1928. But measuring&nbsp;only 1&quot; in diameter and awash in a sea of stars, Pease 1 is nearly impossible&nbsp;to detect in backyard telescopes. Its central star shines at magnitude 15.0.&nbsp;The nebula and the star eluded my gaze in the Genesis. The cluster is also&nbsp;host to a wealth of variable stars (nearly 100 are known). Jones points out&nbsp;that M15 ranks third behind M3 and the famous southern globular Omega&nbsp;Centauri in the number of variable stars it contains.</p>
<p class="font49">In 1974, M15 was discovered to be a source of x-ray energy, which, together with the cluster's apparent tightness, led some astronomers to&nbsp;conjecture that a black hole lurked at its center. The Hubble Space</p><img src="Deep-sky companions the Messier objects by Stephen James OMeara (z-lib_files/Deep-sky companions the Messier objects by Stephen James OMeara (z-lib-59.jpg" style="width:247pt;height:364pt;"/>
<p class="font49">Telescope, however, disproved that by resolving the cluster virtually to its core and revealing nothing extraordinary about it. Instead, astronomers&nbsp;now believe that the x-ray energy might be coming from one or more&nbsp;supernova remnants.</p><div>

<p class="font49">Located 2%° west-northwest of 4.7-magnitude Gamma (7) Scuti, in the spine of the Milky Way, is a most tantalizing sight - a fan of nebulosity (315&nbsp;light years in extent, or about 20,000 times the diameter of the solar&nbsp;system) atop a loosely scattered cluster of stars. But as fine asMIG appears&nbsp;through a telescope, the view does not compare with the cornucopia of&nbsp;elaborate detail revealed in photographs made through large telescopes.&nbsp;Burnham, in his book, calls its photographic appearance &quot;one of the great&nbsp;masterworks of the heavens/<sup>1</sup> and his description of the nebulous&nbsp;lence bears repeating:</p>
<p class="font49">Thrusting boldly into the heart of the cloud rises a huge pinnacle like a cosmic mountain, the celestial throne of the <span class="font49" style="font-style:italic;">Star Queen&nbsp;</span><span class="font49">herself, wonderfully outlined in silhouette against the glowing fire-mist. ...

<p class="font49">Visible as a hazy patch with the naked eye, the M16 complex occupies the northern end of a large S-shaped asterism of stars, which, if viewed together at 23 x with north up, looks very much like a seahorse.

<p class="font49">together create one of the most mystifying sights visible in galactic nebulae - tidal waves of dark matter that appear to be scrubbing away the&nbsp;bright coast of gas with their heavy ebb and (low. Earlier this century,&nbsp;astronomer Fred Hoyle believed that we were witnessing the expansion of&nbsp;hoi gas into cooler gas, with the hot gas empting like an exploding bomb.&nbsp;And that is largely what recent images from the Hubble Space Telescope&nbsp;have revealed: ebony pillars trillions of miles long dramatically being&nbsp;boiled away by the ultraviolet radiation of nearby stars. Shooting off the&nbsp;column tips are tapered nodules of gas (EGGs), each as wide as our solar&nbsp;system, where star formation is occurring.</p>
<p class="font49">The Ghost and its associated dark clouds are an extreme visual challenge in small telescopes<span class="font30">・</span><span class="font49"> unlike the dark channels and swirls so clearly visible in M8. Do take up the challenge however. From Hawaii, the 4-inch&nbsp;can easily pick out the location of the dark northern wedge and reveal a&nbsp;definite V-shaped hole in the heart of the Ghost (the top of the Queen and&nbsp;her throne). A curious bright patch of nebulosity or unresolved clustering&nbsp;of stars lies just to the south of that V (see the drawing). In most photographs I have seen, this region is overexposed. If you spend the lime&nbsp;carefully scmtinizing the southeastern extremities of the nebula, you&nbsp;might notice an absence of gas there - Burnham's &quot;cosmic mountain/'&nbsp;Can you trace out the faint wisps of dark nebulae between the mountain&nbsp;and the top of the throne?</span></p>
<p class="font49">The young, hot cluster illuminating the nebula dominates the northwest part of the Ghost. The cluster measures some 30 light years across and it is approximately 800,000 years old, though some of the youngest&nbsp;stars might be only 50,000 years old. There is a challenging double for the&nbsp;4-inch near the center of the Ghost's head. It is just below its left &quot;eye,' in a&nbsp;faint stream of nebulosity.</p>

<p class="font49">More Messier objects, namely 15, are located in Sagittarius than in any other constellation. And for good reason. The mythical Archer stands vigil&nbsp;in the direction of the center of our galaxy, the area most crowded with&nbsp;stars, dust, and gas. No wonder then that this parcel of sky yields the greatest variety and concentration of galactic star clusters and nebulae, including M17, which is a combination of both. With the exception of the Orion</p>
<p class="font49">Nebula (M42), M17 is the brightest galactic nebula visible to observers at mid-northern latitudes.</p>
<p class="font49">The Swan, as this emission nebula is often called, can be seen with the naked eye as a 6th-magnitude patch of light 2%° south ofM16 and 2%°&nbsp;southwest of Gamma (7) Scuti. In his 1889 <span class="font49" style="font-style:italic;">Celestial Handbook,</span><span class="font49"> George E&nbsp;Chambers was the first to compare this peculiar-shaped nebulosity to a&nbsp;swan floating on water. He was alluding to M17's brightest features,&nbsp;namely a long bar of gas (the swan's body), which is topped on the southwestern end by a faint hook (the swan's curved neck). But with a glance at&nbsp;23 x, 2117 first appears as a long blaze of gas and starlight slashed by dark&nbsp;lanes of obscuring matter; consider, now, that this bar spans 12 light years,&nbsp;<sub>or</sub> 72 trillion miles, of space. Camille Flammarion likened this lengthy&nbsp;feature to a &quot;smoke-drift, fantastically wreathed by the wind,&quot; a wonderfully believable impression.</span></p>
<p class="font49">The faint hook of the swan's neck should materialize soon after you survey the bar. Stay with low power and let your eye drift across the field in&nbsp;all directions. The swan appears to be swimming in a faint mist rising from&nbsp;a black pool. With medium power, concentrate on the southern half of the&nbsp;swan and you might see long vapors rising off its back and neck. A prominent “check mark&quot; of dark nebulosity forms the crook in the swan's neck&nbsp;(this is not to be confused with the bright nebula, which also has the&nbsp;appearance of a check mark). Now use high power to look at the star&nbsp;marking the western end of the bright bar. Immediately encompassing it&nbsp;are four bright knots of gas forming a Celtic cross.</p>
<p class="font49">The ghostly hook has given rise to the nebula's other nicknames-the Omega Nebula, because of its resemblance to the Greek letter &quot;omega&quot;&nbsp;(0), or the Horsehoe Nebula - names introduced by Smyth in the nineteenth century Others have commented on the nebula's resemblance to&nbsp;the number 2. But, as my drawing shows, the 2, the Horseshoe, or the&nbsp;Swan is but a part of a vast and elaborate network of gas and dust. It takes a&nbsp;discerning eye and a combination of moderate and high powers to bring&nbsp;out the finest details within the nebulous regions.</p>
<p class="font49">For example, notice how the hook actually forms a complete loop, the northernmost portion being the most difficult to make out, requiring&nbsp;averted vision and patience. Note also the apparent absence of starlight&nbsp;wilhin the loop. This is probably caused by a cloud of obscuring matter.&nbsp;Certainly this is the darkest region in the entire nebula; it looks like an ink&nbsp;stain in very long-exposure photographs. If you return to low power and&nbsp;really study the faint envelope of nebulosity surrounding the swan, which&nbsp;measures 40' x 30' (about half the size of the Orion Nebula), you will dis-cover that it is not symmetric. It ends abruptly to the west of the swan's&nbsp;head and the &quot;black hole.” It's as if the swan has sailed westward across a</p><div>

It's a question&nbsp;to consider, because this globular belongs to a group of such clusters concentrated around the galactic center (M19 lies a little more than 3,000&nbsp;light years from it). Light traveling from these distant objects is dimmed&nbsp;by intervening dust and gas, so it's hard to judge their sizes; foreground&nbsp;stars in the rich Milky Way can easily appear disguised as globular cluster&nbsp;members.

<p><span class="font48" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">ngc: A magnificent object, very large and bright, trifid, a&nbsp;double star involved.</span></p></div><br clear="all">
<p class="font49">Ifyou look at this region-which is about 5° (two finger-widths) west-norihwest of 3rd-magnitude Lambda (X) Sagittarii - with the naked eye, you should immediately see two hazes (M8 and M20) making an arc with&nbsp;the 5th-magnitude star 4 Sagittarii %° to the west. Use binoculars or a wide&nbsp;field of view to see the &quot;fishhook&quot; of Milky Way (NGC 6526) between M20&nbsp;and M8. Now concentrate on the interior of the fishhook. Do you see a&nbsp;&quot;black hole&quot;?</p>
<p class="font49">My guess is that Messier and his contemporaries must have first noticed these hazes with their naked eyes (as they probably did with M24,&nbsp;M42, M44, and M45, etc.). But when Messier turned his telescopes on&nbsp;M20, he noticed not a nebula, but a cluster of stars. Only in his description&nbsp;of M21 does he say that both M21 and M20 are enveloped in nebulosity.&nbsp;Messier never resolved the tiny glow of the Trifid in his small telescope,&nbsp;and the cluster he referred to is in the southern portion of the &quot;cruciform&nbsp;group&quot; cited by Webb.</p>
<p class="font49">Webb's Cross is a fine collection of roughly a half-dozen 6th- and 7th-magnitude stars (shaped like a cross with warped arms) that appears to the naked eye as a single nebulous patch; M21 marks the northern tip of&nbsp;the cross and M20 the base. So I can understand Messier*s confusion: to&nbsp;the naked eye, these two clusters appear to be immersed in a cocoon of&nbsp;galactic gas, which vanished when he employed his optically inferior telescope. By the way, like the crossbow of stars in M8,1 prefer to recognize&nbsp;Webb's Cross as an asterism, though I wonder if it is really a cluste<span class="font28">匚</span></p>
<p class="font49">There is a minor mystery here. Messier notes that the brightest star inM21 is 11 Sagittarii, but that star lies 2° to the southeast of the presently&nbsp;recognized cluster! He obviously misidentified the star, but someone who&nbsp;likes to model history from shreds of evidence might have fun trying to&nbsp;decipher exactly what happened here. I precessed Messier's 1764 positions for M20 and M21. and everything seems to be in order.</p>
<p class="font49">John Herschel is credited with being the first to call M20 the Trifid Nebula. A small but noble cloud of glowing gas, M20 looks more like a&nbsp;four-leaf clover glazed by frost than a tri-lobed nebula. The name &quot;trifid&quot; is</p><div><img src="Deep-sky companions the Messier objects by Stephen James OMeara (z-lib_files/Deep-sky companions the Messier objects by Stephen James OMeara (z-lib-73.jpg" style="width:169pt;height:151pt;"/></div><br clear="all"><div>
<p class="font49">very deceiving (especially to anyone who first sees it in a photograph); it refers only to the nebula's three brightest southern portions. Do you find it&nbsp;strange that John Herschel would have called this nebula a trifid when his&nbsp;father, William, had already catalogued it in <span class="font49" style="font-style:italic;">four</span><span class="font49"> portions? Anyway I&nbsp;prefer the clover metaphor for two reasons. First, M20 has the shape of&nbsp;one, and second, because the fourth lobe is faint in small telescopes, you&nbsp;should feel lucky if you glimpse it!</span></p>
<p class="font49">The leaves of the clover are separated by dark lanes of obscuring matter emanating from a central well of darkness. Use high magnification&nbsp;to peer into the well and, given stable atmospheric conditions, you might&nbsp;see the discrete triple star HN 40. The two brightest members (7.6 and 8.7&nbsp;magnitude) display a striking color difference. The brighter one, a lype-07 star, for some reason has a mustard hue, while the other is a dying&nbsp;ember, charcoal-colored with a spark of red. The third star shines at magnitude 10.7 and looks colorless in the 4-inch. The 7.6-magnitude primary&nbsp;ofHN 40 appears to be M20*s main source of illumination, though other&nbsp;hot stars, cloaked by dark matter, could contribute energy as well.</p>
<p class="font49">I do see a trifid nebula at low power, though it is not the one Herschel refers to. The Trifid itself is one leaf of that; a bail of gas surrounds the 7.4-magnitude star just 10' to the north (the second leaf). Now, use averted&nbsp;vision to follow the streamers of celestial fog that waft to the west. Do you&nbsp;see where more gas is illuminated by the 6th-magnitude star marking the&nbsp;western arm of Webb's Cross? All the nebulosity associated with the Trifid&nbsp;spans about 30 light years in space, and its total apparent size is two-thirds&nbsp;that of the full moon.</p>
<p class="font49">Less than a degree northeast of the Clover glimmers M21, a bright spread of young stars, about 50 of which are easily visible in small telescopes. Although it is listed as covering an area of 15', M2Ts boundaries&nbsp;are poorly defined. Use high power to pierce the hazy heart of M21, the&nbsp;haze being an illusion created by numerous unresolved stars. Do you see&nbsp;the cluster's &quot;spiral&quot; structure? I can follow arms of stars flowing away&nbsp;from the central triangle of stars. One of these stars looks blue with a him&nbsp;of yellow, while another looks blue with a hint of red. Overall, the clusters&nbsp;stars appear white with just tinges of color. Use low power to appreciate&nbsp;the linear alignment of many of its fainter members. With a little flight of&nbsp;fancy, I see the hazy heart with its flashes of star color as a firefly, and the&nbsp;swirls of stars as its whimsical path across the heavens.</p>
<p class="font49">Here is a naked-eye challenge for you. Can you resolve Webb's Cross and separate M21 from M20?</p><div>

<p class="font49">Without question, M22 should be called the &quot;Great Sagittarius Cluster/' It is a bonfire of a half-million suns that blazes at magnitude 5.2 and measures 33* across - about the apparent diameter of the fill! moon. It ranks&nbsp;third only to Omega Centauri and 47 Tucanae among globulars in brightness and apparent size. Burnham writes that J. R. R.

<p class="font49">swarms of stars, many surprises await your gaze. The core of the cluster appears to sit in a hook of 10th- and 11 th-magnitude stars on the south&nbsp;and west sides. It looks as if the cluster has been snagged by this hook of&nbsp;stars while drifting through space, like flotsam in a river getting snared by&nbsp;a hanging branch.

<p class="font49">The arcing patterns of the clusters 75 brightest stars entice the telescopic viewer to form a creative mental image of some kind. Burnham suggests an outline of a Chinese temple, or a bit of calligraphy. John Mallas&nbsp;saw a bat in flight, and I couldn't agree more. Admittedly, I am partial to&nbsp;bats, so I need no further convincing.</p>
<p class="font49">You really need low power and a north-up orientation of the cluster to fully appreciate the bat motif (see the drawing). A faint string of stars&nbsp;flowing southeast of an 8th-magnitude star meet with a decidedly elliptical pattern of stars to form the bat's tail and body. Its wings arc to the&nbsp;southwest and northeast. Opposite-curving arcs southeast of the stellar&nbsp;ellipse seem to flow away from the head of the bat. With a stretch of the&nbsp;imagination, I see these waves of starlight as the bat*s ultrasonic screams.&nbsp;A tight triangle of stars in front of the bat could be the insect it has echolocated. Can you see the dark stream of nebulosity between the bat's head&nbsp;and the first ultrasonic wave?</p>
<p class="font49">Creative perception is an important part of astronomy's heritage. What are the constellations but figments of some creative individuals'&nbsp;minds. Some familiar star patterns, like Orion's Belt and the Big Dipper,&nbsp;are even household names. Looking for shapes, likenesses, and fanciful&nbsp;imagery in patterns of stars and nebulosity makes stargazing more fun&nbsp;and accessible, and easier to share with others. It can also help you&nbsp;remember subtle details of an object or region of sky. Memorizing star&nbsp;patterns through the telescope can be the first step to making discoveries.&nbsp;If, for example, a new star (a nova) were to appear near M23 - disrupting&nbsp;the square, or the boat, or (he bat motif you had become familiar with -you would recognize that something was different; the shape you creaied&nbsp;would appear altered. This is how nova hunters George Alcock and Peter&nbsp;Collins each have discovered four new stars - using binoculars!</p>
<p class="font49">At 72 x the bat loses its impact. Try, however, (o locate what looks like a little spoon holding a peanut (again, view with north up). At high power,&nbsp;the entire cluster is clumped in little isolated groups of stars separated by&nbsp;meandering rivers of dark nebulosity, which seem to empty into (wo pools&nbsp;of darkness (on either side of the bat*s tail). Using 130x, see if you can&nbsp;locate a trio of double stars in the cluster's northwest quadrant.</p>

<p class="font49">Through the Genesis at 23 x, no sight in the visible universe shares M24's mystical qualities. I was amazed to find this seemingly three-dimensional patch of Milky Way beaming with a distinctive pale green&nbsp;sheen, suggesting a composition more of gelatin than starlight, a giant&nbsp;guglena wrapped in stellar filigree.</p><div>
<p class="font49">The entire star cloud is blotted with pools of dark nebulosity. One</p></div><br clear="all">
<p class="font49">prominent pool (Barnard 92) resides on the cluster's northwest side; it is surrounded by a succession of moderately bright stars. Use high power to&nbsp;concentrate on the center of the pool. Do you see your &quot;reflection&quot; - an&nbsp;illusion created by the light of a solitary 12th-magnitude star shimmering&nbsp;in the center? A wide canal of darkness to the north ofM24 creates a sharp&nbsp;northern border. But the cloud seems to continue beyond the canal in a&nbsp;tapering spit toward the Swan Nebula.</p>
<p class="font49">Equally remarkable are the vast tracts of dark nebulosity to the west and east. These rival the star cloud in splendor. When I place M24 in the&nbsp;center of the field of view at 23 x, then move one field to the northwest, I&nbsp;feel as if I've stepped off a steep cliff of starlight and am free-falling into a&nbsp;dizzying celestial abyss. If you relax your gaze you might see the everwidening wedge-shaped array of dark veins running off to the southeast.&nbsp;Wide-field photographs of this region reveal a dark corridor about the size&nbsp;of M24 to the southeast. It looks as if someone has lifted M24 like a log&nbsp;from that spot and dropped it in its present location, leaving behind its&nbsp;barren imprint in the celestial &quot;soil.&quot;</p>
<p class="font49">Notice the description of M24 in the <span class="font49" style="font-style:italic;">NGC,</span><span class="font49"> which obviously could not have been referring to the same object as Messier's &quot;large nebulosity<sup>0</sup> with&nbsp;a diameter of 2°. M24 was formerly misidentified as the 11.4-magnitude&nbsp;<sup>star</sup> cluster NGC 6603, which resides in the northern portion of M24, just&nbsp;15* north-northeast of an orange 6.4-magnitude K5 star. Messier probably&nbsp;would not have seen this tiny, compact glow, which shines feebly with the&nbsp;light of an out-of-focus 11 th-magnitude star. Even from the dark skies of&nbsp;Hawaii, I nearly overlooked that minuscule fuzzy knot, which at low&nbsp;power affords only a hint of resolution. High power reveals a semicircular&nbsp;dark patch just south of it. Whereas for most objects I recommend a long,&nbsp;steady gaze to distinguish a particular feature, to see this dark loop you&nbsp;must give a quick, brief glance. That's because for dark nebulae, the longer&nbsp;you look in the eyepiece, the more dark nebulosity you see, and the dark&nbsp;feature youre interested in soon gets lost in a complex web of dark&nbsp;streamers and spots that emerge from the background, especially with&nbsp;averted vision. In fact, if you spend a few minutes staring at M24, the star&nbsp;cloud will suddenly be swarming with dark veins.</span></p>
<p class="font49">Finally, compare the color of M24 with that of a smaller star cloud south of Mu (ji) Sagittarii. The Mu Sagittarii cloud looks gray and diffuse, I&nbsp;once thought I had breathed on the lens. It contrasts with the greenish&nbsp;glow of M24!</p><div><img src="Deep-sky companions the Messier objects by Stephen James OMeara (z-lib_files/Deep-sky companions the Messier objects by Stephen James OMeara (z-lib-81.jpg" style="width:245pt;height:377pt;"/></div><br clear="all">

It lies about 3%° east-southeast of the Small Sagittarius Star&nbsp;Cloud (M24) and just south of an inverted spoon of binocular stars, hs&nbsp;estimated 600 stars stretch across 20 light years of space, and the 30 or so&nbsp;bright ones that we can see cover a area of sky. M25 is the only Messier&nbsp;object cross-referenced in the <span class="font49" style="font-style:italic;">Index Catalogue</span><span class="font49"> (IC).</span></p>
<p class="font49">The main body of stars forms a north-south oriented figure eight with legs extending from al! sides; in this way the cluster looks very beetlelike. The western half of the southern section of the &quot;8&quot; is filled with stars;</p>
<p class="font49">this curious-looking arrangement is Smyth's pretty knot of minute glimmers. Just east of the knot blazes the Cepheid-type variable star U Sagittarii, a member ofM25, whose magnitude waxes and wanes between&nbsp;6.3 and 7.1 about every 6 days, 18 hours; near minimum the star's light&nbsp;becomes yellower. With a little effort you can chart its subtle variation in&nbsp;intensity and derive at its period. Can you see this star with the naked eye&nbsp;when it is at maximum?</p>
<p class="font49">At medium power several strong arcs of starlight spread across the field of view like rippled dunes glistening in a midday sun. Shadows fill the&nbsp;troughs between each crest and fade into the misty light of the stellar&nbsp;background. (On the off chance that you have had the opportunity to&nbsp;study an alligator's foot up close, the tapered digits of these star streams&nbsp;will look surprisingly familiar.)</p>
<p class="font49">M25's stellar arcs are so visually stunning that the cluster is beautiful for that reason alone. Once again, we have the opportunity to focus attention not on the bright stars but on the wisps of dark nebulosity-ifs a skill&nbsp;worth developing, because it will add a new dimension to your observing.&nbsp;First use low power, and let your eye drift until it finds a comfortable position for averted vision. Then relax your gaze; M25's dark central stream&nbsp;becomes inky black and seems to lengthen well beyond the eastern and&nbsp;western edges of the cluster. The rest of the cluster looks like a child has&nbsp;taken a felt-tip pen to it and begun inking out the stars row by row.</p>
<p class="font49">After studying M25 look immediately to its east. There you will see a patch of Milky Way about the same angular size of M25 that looks like an&nbsp;afterimage of the cluster.</p>

<p class="font49">I first encountered M26 during a comet sweep in the rich Milky Way region in and around Scutum - perhaps just as Messier had done more than 200&nbsp;years before. Using 23 x<sub>t</sub> I noticed the cluster's concentrated glow enter&nbsp;the eyepiece, but it looked so small that I paid it little attention, figuring it&nbsp;was just an asterism; more intriguing was the 8th-magnitude globular&nbsp;cluster NGC 6712 about 2° to the northeast. After admiring the globular, a&nbsp;twinge of curiosity caused me to return to that tiny asterism, in which an&nbsp;ice-blue gem sparkled conspicuously amid a sprinkling of diamond dust.&nbsp;Suddenly I realized that this speckled glow was M26. From brighter skies,&nbsp;this object might well be overlooked, because its tantalizing gleam of&nbsp;background stars would be all but washed out. M26 is an innocuous knot&nbsp;of stars which spans an area of 12 light years and contains 120 stars in a&nbsp;disk 8' in apparent diameter, though only about two dozen of the suns are&nbsp;readily seen in the 4-inch. That's pretty condensed compared to other&nbsp;Messier open clusters. M25, for example, is about four times larger in&nbsp;apparent diameter and measures 20 light years across, though it is also&nbsp;twice as close as M26. The brighter ofM26*s stars shine at only magnitude&nbsp;10.3, for a combined magnitude of 8. You'll find the cluster less than 1°&nbsp;east-southeast of 5th-magnitude Delta (8) Scuti and about 3%° southsouthwest ofMll in the stunning Scutum Star Cloud.</p>
<p class="font49">The entire region surrounding M26 appears mired in dark nebulosity and the low-power field is haunted by fleeting hazes of unresolved stars. Moderate power shows two rows of stars extending to the north&nbsp;from the cluster's central diamond of stars. These pincers are clearly&nbsp;divided by a lane of obscuring matter, though other observers have doc&nbsp;mented it as a &quot;hole,&quot; bereft of stars. James Cuffiey of Indiana University&nbsp;first noticed the black heart of M26 in 1940, estimating that the star&nbsp;density at the cluster's core was 13 percent less than in the regions immediately surrounding this 3'-diamcier zone of darkness. The diamond is&nbsp;further caged to the southwest and northeast by two thicker bars of blackness. With averted vision and a relaxed gaze the entire cluster seems to&nbsp;smolder with smoke. Try defocusing the telescope slightly and concentrating on the dark areas, and a most remarkable vision materializes: the&nbsp;shadow of a crucifix with light and dark rays radiating from its center.&nbsp;Look roughly one cluster diameter away from M26 in all directions and&nbsp;see if you don't pick out a &quot;sacred circle<sup>0</sup> of similarly bright stars enclosing&nbsp;the cluster and cross.</p><div><img src="Deep-sky companions the Messier objects by Stephen James OMeara (z-lib_files/Deep-sky companions the Messier objects by Stephen James OMeara (z-lib-85.jpg" style="width:170pt;height:149pt;"/></div><br clear="all"><div>

<p class="font49">Although no star in Vulpecula shines brighter than magnitude 4.4, this summer constellation does boast the most famous of planetary nebulae,&nbsp;M27, the Dumbbell Nebula. Discovered by Messier in 1764, the Dumbbell&nbsp;got its nickname much later from its resemblance to a bodybuilder^ hand&nbsp;weight. M27, a &quot;splendid enigma,&quot; as Smyth described it in the <span class="font49" style="font-style:italic;">Cycle of&nbsp;Celestial Objects,</span><span class="font49"> is one of the closer planetaries (815 light years away),&nbsp;and its physical diameter of 1.2 light years also makes it one of the larger.&nbsp;The gaseous material was blown from the blue-dwarf star now at its&nbsp;center during one of the star's death throes 48,000 years ago (which makes&nbsp;M27 more than twice as old as typical planetaries). M27 is a multiple-shell&nbsp;planetary One shell, of doubly ionized oxygen, is expanding at a velocity</span></p><img src="Deep-sky companions the Messier objects by Stephen James OMeara (z-lib_files/Deep-sky companions the Messier objects by Stephen James OMeara (z-lib-88.jpg" style="width:249pt;height:336pt;"/>

<p class="font49">of 9 miles per second* while another shell, of ionized nitrogen, is expanding at 20 miles per second. From our vantage point, the whole gaseous ring is swelling 6* per century The gas shells glow from excitation by ultraviolet radiation emitted by the hot central star.</p>
<p class="font49">M27 is easily spotted in 7 x 50 binoculars as a roughly 7th-magni-tude, 8' x 6' glow about 3° due north of 3.5-magnitude Gamma Cy) Sagitta, or less than south of 5.7-magnitude 14 Vulpeculae. It is one of the few&nbsp;nebulous Messier objects whose visual impression truly matches that of&nbsp;its photographic image. At23x, the brightest portion of the nebula shines&nbsp;with a pale green light and has a distinct hourglass shape (oriented north<span class="font30">・</span><span class="font49">&nbsp;east-southwest). Faint loops of nebulosity can also be seen extending to&nbsp;the northwest and southeast. In the 4-inch, these-faint extensions vanish&nbsp;with increased magnification, because the surface brightness becomes&nbsp;too low for them to stand out against the sky background.</span></p>
<p class="font49">When seen in a 3° field of view, the Dumbbell Nebula appears to be standing upright on a long blanket of stars. Look carefully where the&nbsp;Dumbbell stands, and see if the star blanket does not seem to be sagging&nbsp;under the Dumbbelfs weight. This wonderful illusion is created by clouds&nbsp;of dark nebulosity, which frame the star blanket. You will need a dark sky,&nbsp;though, to see this well. Now return to M27. The dumbbell-shaped gas&nbsp;cloud is part of a more complex structure - namely, the dumbbell sits&nbsp;inside a football-shaped shell of gas oriented 90° from it. There's a definite&nbsp;asymmetry: the southwestern lobe of the dumbbell is brighter than the&nbsp;northwestern lobe, while the northwestern side of the &quot;football&quot; is&nbsp;brighter than the southeastern side.</p>
<p class="font49">High magnification should reveal the planetary*s turbulent interior Look for several meandering swirls that create a marblelike texture among&nbsp;a field of foreground stars. Stare at the southwest lobe of the Dumbbell&nbsp;and you may see the clumps of light matter and dark matter coming&nbsp;together to form a wedge-shaped face - devilish almost, with curved, protruding horns.</p>
<p class="font49">But M27's central star is the real demon. Although stars of 14th magnitude are usually a cinch from pristine skies, glimpsing this one requires keen averted vision. The reason might lie in the difficulty of seeing stars&nbsp;through nebulosity. Using high magnifications usually solves this&nbsp;problem, but <span class="font28">让 </span><span class="font49">doesn't seem to in this case. It is interesting that drawings&nbsp;ofM27 made by Rosse, John Herschel, Smyth, and Leopold Trouvelot, who&nbsp;all used sizable telescopes a century or more ago, do not include the&nbsp;central star! Furthermore, a 1908 Lick Observatory catalogue logs the&nbsp;central star as magnitude 12&gt; and Mallas described it as 13th magnitude.&nbsp;But. more recently, </span><span class="font49" style="font-style:italic;">Sky Catalogue2000.0</span><span class="font49"> lists the star's magnitude at 13.9.&nbsp;and Luginbuhl and Skiff, 13.8. It could be that the earlier magnitude estimates were just off a little, but has anyone investigated the possible variable nature of this star (or of its “ 17th-magnitude<sup>H</sup> companion)?</span></p><div><img src="Deep-sky companions the Messier objects by Stephen James OMeara (z-lib_files/Deep-sky companions the Messier objects by Stephen James OMeara (z-lib-89.jpg" style="width:248pt;height:250pt;"/></div><br clear="all">
<p class="font49">Like M23, M28 is another lost gem in the glittering Sagittarius Milky Way. This tiny (10*) but charming globular cluster suffers the misfortune of&nbsp;being too close to the bigger and overpoweringly beautiful globular M22.&nbsp;M28 lies only 1° northwest of 2.8-magnitude Lambda (X) Sagittarii, the&nbsp;golden <span class="font49" style="font-style:italic;">K2</span><span class="font49"> star marking the top of the Sagittarius teapot, and can be seen&nbsp;in binoculars shining at 7th magnitude.

<p class="font49">The view is very different at 130 x! A tiny, peach-colored nucleus is surrounded by several patches of stars.

<p class="font49">About southeast of Lambda, you'll find the 9th-magnitude globular cluster NGC 6638. At23x, NGC 6638, M28, and M22 can all just barely fit into the same field of view If your telescope allows it, take some time to&nbsp;look at them together. Here are three globulars of vastly different visual&nbsp;proportions. M22 seems monstrous in comparison to minuscule NGC&nbsp;6638, which spans only 5'; M22 is five times larger in apparent size! And do&nbsp;you see a color difference between M28 and M22?</p><div><img src="Deep-sky companions the Messier objects by Stephen James OMeara (z-lib_files/Deep-sky companions the Messier objects by Stephen James OMeara (z-lib-91.jpg" style="width:163pt;height:129pt;"/></div><br clear="all"><div>

Still, this open cluster is visible to the naked eye as a 6.6-magnitude &quot;star&quot; just&nbsp;2° south-southeast of 2.2-magnitude Gamma (7) Cygni. It lies in a dense&nbsp;region of Milky Way that runs the length of the celestial Swan (Cygnus) <span class="font28">一 </span><span class="font49">a&nbsp;region laced with dark lanes of interstellar dust.

It would&nbsp;no doubt be a more striking sight were it not for the dense obscuring&nbsp;matter that veils the region, dimming the duster's light by three magnitudes!</span></p>
<p class="font49">I almost agreed with John Mallas, who said that each increase in magnification reduces the cluster's beauty. But when I used 130 x and let&nbsp;my imagination fly, I saw a stream of 13th-magnitude stars coursing&nbsp;through the banks of brighter stars. Perhaps in larger instruments this&nbsp;stream would not have been so pretty, but it was quite alluring in the 4-inch. because it was so faint. Then something interesting happened. As&nbsp;my eye followed that elegant river, my mind drifted to a time when I stood&nbsp;waist high in sawgrass in the Florida Everglades. There my surroundings&nbsp;looked rather bleak, until I caught sight of a single orange wildflower. That&nbsp;tiny splash of color transformed a dull landscape into a grand sensation.&nbsp;Likewise, the delicate stream of stars in M29 turns an otherwise unremarkable cluster into a memorable one.</p>

<p class="font49">To the true romantic of astronomy, M31 will always be known as the “Great <span class="font49" style="font-style:italic;">Nebula</span><span class="font49"> in Andromeda&quot; - a name bestowed upon it before spectroscopy revealed that this luminous mist was not the protoplasmic soup&nbsp;of a solar system in formation but a distant island universe like our own&nbsp;Milky Way Galaxy. An enormous pinwheel of dust and gas, the Andromeda&nbsp;Galaxy contains some 300 billion suns spread across 130,000 light years. It&nbsp;is rushing toward us at 185 miles per second. M31 is among the largest&nbsp;galaxies known and is by far the largest member of the Local Group of&nbsp;galaxies, which includes our Milky Way and some two dozen smaller&nbsp;systems. The Andromeda and Milky Way galaxies dominate the Local&nbsp;Group with their size, with M31 being twice as massive as our Milky Way.&nbsp;And though we see the Andromeda Galaxy nearly edge on, astronomers&nbsp;see enough structure to speculate that the Milky Way is similar in shape&nbsp;and structure. If you were in the Andromeda Galaxy looking at the Milky&nbsp;Way, the Milky Way would appear much the same way as M31 does to us.</span></p>
<p class="font49">At 2.3 million light years distant, M31 is also one of the farthest objects visible to the naked eye. Under reasonably dark skies it appears as</p>
<p class="font49">a cocoon of nebulous vapor 1° west of 4.5-magnitude Nu (v) Andromedae in the Chained Maiden's belt. M31 stretches 3°, or nearly 6 moon diameters, on the most transparent nights. A good pair of binoculars will show&nbsp;some of the galaxy's subtle detail. Even 7X35 binoculars will reveal its&nbsp;elliptical disk, whose surface brightness gradually fades away from a star<span class="font30">・</span></p>
<p><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;">The Messier Objects</span></p><img src="Deep-sky companions the Messier objects by Stephen James OMeara (z-lib_files/Deep-sky companions the Messier objects by Stephen James OMeara (z-lib-98.png" style="width:171pt;height:132pt;"/>
<p class="font49">like core. The billions of suns in the core are so tightly packed that astronomers believe there may be a black hole at the center.</p>
<p class="font49">The galaxy's northwestern rim has a sharp edge to it, which marks the location of a prominent dark lane slicing through that part of the&nbsp;galaxy; in contrast, the galaxys southeastern rim diffuses gradually into&nbsp;the sky background. Binoculars will also reveal two of M3Ts companion&nbsp;galaxies: M32 and M110. M32 looks like a slightly swollen 8th-magnitude&nbsp;star on M3Ts outermost bright rim, roughly south and slightly east of&nbsp;the nucleus. M110 is a similarly bright, though larger, elliptical haze 37'&nbsp;northwest ofM3 l*s nucleus. For more on Ml 10, see pages 282-3.</p>
<p class="font49">In the 4-inch at 23 x, a bright yellow &quot;star&quot; marks the very center of the Andromeda Galaxy. It lies inside several tightly wrapped pale yellow&nbsp;haloes, which start out circular close to the core but become progressively&nbsp;more elliptical and more skewed toward the southwest farther away from&nbsp;the nucleus. This teardrop-shaped patch of golden light is surrounded by&nbsp;an enormous ashen elliptical halo grooved with faint dust lanes. The&nbsp;detailed drawing on the preceding page is a composite: after spending&nbsp;three hours each night over several nights examining the galaxy, I combined the views made with low, medium, and high powers. I concentrated&nbsp;on the nuclear region the first night, the northeast portion on the next&nbsp;night, and the southwest sector last; the two satellite galaxies were viewed&nbsp;on separate nights.</p>
<p class="font49">Besides the prominent nuclear region, the most striking feature of M31 is a conspicuous dust lane running along its northwest edge. One&nbsp;night I followed that lane southwestward for half the galaxy's radius before&nbsp;it looped back in classic spiral fashion. When I used 130 x to study the&nbsp;portion of this lane lying closest to the nucleus, it appeared very turbulent. One could spend hours trying to visualize patterns in the lacy swirls&nbsp;and splotches of dust. See if you can detect a leopard-spot pattern there; it</p><div><img src="Deep-sky companions the Messier objects by Stephen James OMeara (z-lib_files/Deep-sky companions the Messier objects by Stephen James OMeara (z-lib-99.jpg" style="width:249pt;height:178pt;"/></div><br clear="all">
<p class="font49">almost blends with another dust lane farther to the northwest. Now look just east of the innermost halo surrounding the nucleus. There you shotdd&nbsp;find another lane of dust with two faint dark hooks branching off it to the&nbsp;northeast. If you're having trouble with high magnification, revert to low&nbsp;power, because you will condense the galaxy's light and increase the contrast between the bright haze of the galaxy and the silhouettes of dust.</p>
<p class="font49">The arms in M3Ts outer halo contain some bright concentrations, which, with imagination, look like spits of gray sand between streams of&nbsp;dark matter. Jones said these show best in photographs sensitive to blue&nbsp;light. Interestingly, my eyes appear to be sensitive to blue light, so I can see&nbsp;these concentrations well. English nova and comet discoverer George&nbsp;Alcock is also believed to have blue-sensitive eyes. Other observing&nbsp;friends, like Michael Mattei ofHarvard, Massachusetts, have red-sensitive&nbsp;eyes. One way you can test your eyes for color sensitivity is to observe&nbsp;astronomical objects with blue or red features and see how you fare. You&nbsp;can start with these blue concentrations in M31*s spiral arms. Another&nbsp;good one is NGC 206 close to the galaxy's southwestern rim. This 1' X2'&nbsp;patch of fuzzy light is actually an enormous star cloud within the galaxy&nbsp;that measures 700 x 1,300 light years. Based on my limiting-magnitude&nbsp;studies, about a dozen globular clusters are within range of a good 4-inch&nbsp;telescope under perfect conditions. By the way, have you ever noticed&nbsp;how the extreme tips of M31 *s outer spiral arms curve away from the main&nbsp;body? The southwestern tip curves to the south, while the northeastern&nbsp;tip curves north.</p><div>

<p class="font49">M32 is easy to mistake for a bright star in binoculars. At low and moderate powers in the telescope, M32 is essentially a featureless circular&nbsp;glow. But take the time to look for a faint outer envelope that gives this&nbsp;seemingly round galaxy its elliptical shape. At 130 x, I could discern a definite starlike core with an odd vertical extension running northeast to&nbsp;southwest through the entire galaxy Is this a real feature or an illusion&nbsp;created by a peculiar alignment offoint, unresolved foreground stars? The&nbsp;southeastern side of the nucleus seems to be bordered by an arc of bright&nbsp;haze, while the same distance away to the northeast, there appears to be a&nbsp;faint star that flickers in and out of view; I like to see it as a beacon, a&nbsp;friendly message from a distant neighbor.</p>
<p class="font49">Like M31, M32 is believed to harbor a black hole, but one perhaps 10 times smaller than the one at the heart of M31. Also like M31, M32's light is&nbsp;blue-shifted, but this system appears to be approaching us at a slower&nbsp;speed of 126 miles per second.</p>

<p class="font49">be an impressive sight - an oblique swarm of faintly glittering suns stretching 6° in that hypothetical sky</p>
<p class="font49">Regardless of its true size, the Pinwheel is a great sight from earth. It has long been a naked-eye challenge for amateur astronomers. While&nbsp;some find it easily visible to the naked eye or in binoculars, others cannot&nbsp;see it at all. The problem lies in the galaxy's low surface brightness.&nbsp;Although the total magnitude ofM33 is the same as a 6th-magnitude star,&nbsp;the galaxy's light is spread over an area of sky larger than two full moon&nbsp;diameters, making it appear dim. A dark sky, a steady atmosphere, and&nbsp;good vision are required to see M33 with or without optical aid. Its ease of&nbsp;visibility is, as Walter Scott Houston often stated, a barometer for the&nbsp;clarity of one's observing site. The galaxy is completely washed out in&nbsp;urban skies and can be disappointingly dim from suburban locations&nbsp;even through large-aperture telescopes! Try to see it, though, without&nbsp;optical aid, because M33 is one of the farthest objects visible to the naked&nbsp;eye. Some observers claim M33 cannot be seen with the naked eye at all&nbsp;and that the &quot;glow&quot; is caused by some nearby stars. But the brightest&nbsp;naked<span class="font30">・</span><span class="font49">eye stars near M33 are 7th-magnitude and fainter, so that argument is specious.</span></p>
<p class="font49">The clockwise-swirling spiral of M33 can be spotted 4° west-northwest of 3.4-magnitude Alpha (a) Ttianguli. M33 and M31 lie on opposite sides of, and at nearly equal angular distances from, the 2nd-magnitude&nbsp;red giant Beta (0) Andromedae. Binoculars do a fine job of bringing out&nbsp;the Pinwheefs luster against the black backdrop. Even 7 x 35s show the&nbsp;50,000-light-year-wide galaxy as a distinct oval glow immediately north of&nbsp;an 8th-magnitude star. At 23 x in the 4-inch, the galaxy's light is compressed into a shimmering disk of optimal contrast, with several faint&nbsp;spiral arms sweeping away from a tight, lens-shaped nuclear region, lake&nbsp;a moment to compare the size of that tiny nucleus to the rest of the galaxy;&nbsp;<span class="font48" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">M33's</span><span class="font49"> nucleus contains less than 2 percent of the galaxy's total mass. In&nbsp;comparison, M3Ts nuclear region is about one twenty-fifth the size of the&nbsp;entire galaxy and about five times larger than M32!</span></p>
<p class="font49">Although John Herschel called M33 unfit for high powers, &quot;being imperceptible from want of contrast with 144 x,<sup>H</sup> I find high magnification (130x) perfect for concentrating on its tiny central knot, which&nbsp;appears misshapen by dark matter. Several faint stars or fuzzy kinks lurk&nbsp;in (he misty vicinity of the galaxy's core. Using a 12-inch telescope at&nbsp;225 x, Luginbuhl counted perhaps as many as eight 13th-magnitude stars&nbsp;sprinkled in the southern portion of this region. &quot;The whole surface of the&nbsp;galaxy,&quot; he writes, &quot;is covered with faint stellarings and splotches.<sup>0&nbsp;</sup>Similarly, Rosse saw it full of knots with two S-shaped curves crossing in&nbsp;the center, though only one-long and loose S is conspicuous at low power.</p>
<p class="font49">But, again, high power will reveal some taut and stubby inner spiral structure.</p>
<p class="font49">Without question, M33 is the easiest galaxy beyond the Magellanic Clouds to resolve with large amateur instruments. Skiff notes that many&nbsp;faint clusters, stellar associations, and nebulae embedded in it are within&nbsp;grasp of a 10-inch telescope. I recorded in my observing diary (hat M33's&nbsp;most prominent arms appear lumpy at 23x, and with 72 x the contrast&nbsp;holds up well enough for there to be a suspicion of resolution. M33*s&nbsp;largest HII region (NGC 604) is by far the most conspicuous feature in the&nbsp;galaxy besides the nucleus. Yoifll find it 12' northeast of the nucleus, just&nbsp;r northwest of a 10.5-magnitude star. Luginbuhl saw this feature in a 2.4-inch (60-mm) telescope as a concentrated spot in the halo! Can you see it&nbsp;in binoculars?</p>

<p class="font49">Cast your sights on the constellation Perseus and what first catches your eye is the large misty splotch of the Double Cluster (NGC 869 and NGC&nbsp;884), which in binoculars resolves into a grand pair of bright stellar splatter ings a half-degree apart. Wliile it is curious that the Double Cluster was&nbsp;overlooked by Messier for his catalogue (was it too obviously not a&nbsp;comet?), he did discover another open cluster, now called M34, glimmcr-</p><div>

<p class="font49">&amp; 2<span class="font30">)</span><span class="font49">Andromedae. M34 is a loose aggregation of stars about 100 million years old (much older than either of the Double Cluster components). Its&nbsp;60 members are spread across a scant 10 light years of space. Regardless,</span></p>
<p class="font49">Webb called it one of the finest objects of its class.</p>
<p class="font49">Shining at magnitude 5.7, M34 is clearly visible to the naked eye. Note how much easier M34 is to see than M33. Although they have the&nbsp;same magnitude, M33 is about three times larger in apparent diameter, so&nbsp;it has a lower surface brightness. M34's scattering of bright pearls includes&nbsp;about a dozen suns that shine brighter than 9th magnitude, all of which&nbsp;can be resolved with 7x35 binoculars; several of these are white giants.&nbsp;What looks like the brightest star in M34 shines at magnitude 7.3, but this&nbsp;star is a foreground star, not a true cluster member. One of the brightest&nbsp;true members is a double star known as Struve 44, whose 8.4- and 9.1<span class="font30">・</span><span class="font49">&nbsp;magnitude components are separated by 1.4&quot;.</span></p>
<p class="font49">Although M34 is certainly a first-rate cluster for small telescopes, Walter Scott Houston preferred the view through 15 x 65 binoculars. More&nbsp;magnification, he said, merely spreads out the few bright stars that the&nbsp;binoculars show perfectly well.</p>
<p class="font49">Still, the view of the clusters core at 72 X is quite dramatic. A spray of double stars, many of similar brightness, appear to be fleeing from two&nbsp;8th-magnitude Type&gt;10 gems separated by 20&quot; (the double star hl 123) at&nbsp;the very heart of the cluster. Smyth also noted the gathering of &quot;coarse&nbsp;pairs&quot; in this &quot;scattered but elegant group.&quot; In fact, he seemed to favor the&nbsp;central double more than the cluster itself, calling M34 a &quot;double star in a&nbsp;cluster.&quot;</p>
<p class="font49">After probing the depths of the cluster, return to low power, then slightly defocus the view and look for two large stellar arcs abutting the&nbsp;cluster's core to the southwest (see the drawing). If you visually measure&nbsp;the radius from the core to the outer arc, then look about the same distance to the northeast: you may see some hazy outer arcs of starlight. They&nbsp;might show more clearly if you gently sweep the telescope back and forth&nbsp;over this region. Once you see the arcs, use averted vision to stare at them,&nbsp;and they will resolve into individual stars. The region between the faint&nbsp;arcs and the core looks rather vacuous. But this blank area is actually filled&nbsp;with very faint background stars.</p>
<p class="font49">Algol, the bright star about 5° to the southeast of M34, is one of the most famous variable stars in the night sky. Its placement in the heavens&nbsp;represents the head of Medusa, the serpent-haired Gorgon of classical&nbsp;mythology, held by her slayer Perseus. The &quot;demon star*' usually shines at&nbsp;magnitude 2.1, but nearly every three days it mysteriously fades to magni-</p><img src="Deep-sky companions the Messier objects by Stephen James OMeara (z-lib_files/Deep-sky companions the Messier objects by Stephen James OMeara (z-lib-105.jpg" style="width:249pt;height:344pt;"/><img src="Deep-sky companions the Messier objects by Stephen James OMeara (z-lib_files/Deep-sky companions the Messier objects by Stephen James OMeara (z-lib-106.jpg" style="width:158pt;height:102pt;"/>
<p class="font49">Hide 3.4, before brightening again, all in just 10 hours.

We see this drama unfold as an apparent winking&nbsp;<sub>o</sub>f the star.

The mottled naked-eye appearance is almost aggravating,&nbsp;because no amount of time seems enough to resolve it faithfully. The&nbsp;cluster's brightest members shine between 8th and 9th magnitude and,&nbsp;not surprisingly, lie along that conspicuous eastern wall (actually an arc).&nbsp;Someone with keen, young eyes might be able to resolve a few of the stars&nbsp;in the wall from a good site at high elevation. (Although I can convince&nbsp;myself that the cluster is resolved, I cannot pinpoint the location of any&nbsp;given star accurately enough to prove it; and therein lies the challenge.)</span></p><div><img src="Deep-sky companions the Messier objects by Stephen James OMeara (z-lib_files/Deep-sky companions the Messier objects by Stephen James OMeara (z-lib-108.jpg" style="width:249pt;height:439pt;"/></div><br clear="all">
<p class="font49">The outlying stars fill a 1.5° field and extend east to the 6th-magni-tude star 5 Geminorum - a view best appreciated through a rich-field telescope. When I visually connect the brightest stars in this extreme outer halo, they resemble a scallop shell's wavy edges. The sides of the shell are&nbsp;marked by 5 Geminorum to the east-northeast and the tiny 8.6-magni-tude open cluster NGC2158 to the southwest. A snaking dark river flows&nbsp;between the scallop's halves, making them appear slightly open.</p>
<p class="font49">Star counts in M35 vary dramatically with the observer. Rosse counted 300 in a field of 26\ Luginbuhl and Skiff tally 200-odd stars in a&nbsp;field of 30'. Ake Wallenquist counted 119 stars in a diameter of 30', estimating the stellar density there to be about 6 stars per cubic parsec, which&nbsp;is very loose. (By comparison, the density of M34's core is 21 stars per&nbsp;cubic parsec.) The central stars form a figure eight pattern. A corset of&nbsp;about two dozen stars seems to hold in the cluster's slender waist. This&nbsp;central girdle is flanked by two large voids: one to the south, the other to&nbsp;the northeast. Is this absence of stars caused by obscuring dust in the&nbsp;galactic arm? Look carefully at these voids and see if there isn't a wavy&nbsp;stream of stars originating at the center of each of them. Both streams flow&nbsp;to the east, though the southern one makes a sudden curve to the south. If&nbsp;you concentrate, you might see these streams coming toward you, an illusion (hat adds dimension to the otherwise flat cluster.</p>
<p class="font49">Star streams also radiate in all directions from the figure eight. They connect to an outer ring of similarly bright stars. This view mimics the&nbsp;smoky remains of a fireworks display faintly illuminated by city lights. The&nbsp;nineteenth-century observer Smyth had a similar impression of M35,&nbsp;saying its pattern of stars reminded him of a bursting skyrocket.</p>
<p class="font49">Earlier I mentioned NGC 2158; it's a pint-size star cluster only 5' in diameter that lies southwest of M35. Although NGC 2158 appears&nbsp;smaller and dimmer than M35, the two clusters are really very similar in&nbsp;physical size; it's just that NGC 2158 is six times more distant. Visually,&nbsp;NGC 2158 bears some resemblance to NGC 1907 nearM38 (see page 129);&nbsp;both clusters appear as milky spots with some stars hovering near (he&nbsp;limit of vision.</p>
<p class="font49">Burnham seems to have severely underestimated the brightness of both NGC 2158 and the brightest stars within it. He estimated the cluster&nbsp;to be 11th magnitude with the brightest members being magnitude 16.1&nbsp;was surprised (o find the cluster's milky haze quite easily in the 4-inch,&nbsp;and at 130 x I resolved some of its brighter members. Skiff determined the&nbsp;cluster's visual magnitude to be 8.6, and through an 8-inch telescope he&nbsp;resolved some 50 stars of magnitude 13 or fainter. NGC 2158 is very sensitive to light pollution. I never could see this object through Harvard's 9-inch refractor because of urban skyglow.</p><div>

<p class="font49">M36 is one of three bright Messier clusters decorating a rich band of the Auriga Milky Way (the others being M37 and M38).To find it, look about 8°&nbsp;east of2.7-magnitude Iota (i) Aurigae, or about 6° north-northeast of 1.6-niagnitude Gamma (7) Aurigae. M36 and its closest neighbor, M3&amp;&nbsp;appear as hazy &quot;stars,&quot; pieces of lint clinging to the dusty veil of the Milky&nbsp;Way.

<p class="font49">Telescopically, M36 appears much as Webb characterized it: a **beau-</p>

<p class="font49">tiful assemblage of stars ... very regularly arranged/<sup>1</sup> Its 15 brightest members (between 9th and 11th magnitude) shimmer against a tight,&nbsp;hazy background caused by the feeble light of dozens of 13th- and 14th-magnitude stars. As with other open clusters embedded in the Milky&nbsp;Ways, it's hard to discern the actual outer boundaries of the cluster.</p>
<p class="font49">At 23 x, M36 displays a loose central concentration of stars with two long, slightly curved arms (extending southwest and northeast) and&nbsp;smaller appendages perpendicular to them. D'Arrest saw the central&nbsp;swirls arranged in three tight spirals. Mallas envisioned a crab, and Jones&nbsp;imagined a rocking chair or a miniature Perseus. I see the central association forming a warped cross - one with a strikingly similar orientation to&nbsp;Webb's Cross at the heart of M38 (see page 129). Since the two clusters are&nbsp;neighbors, hop from one to the other and see if you can't make out the&nbsp;twin crosses.</p>
<p class="font49">Switch to medium power to examine the pair of close double stars straddling the cluster's center. The southerly one is Struve 737, a pair of&nbsp;9th<span class="font30">・</span><span class="font49">magnitude stars separated by 1 </span><span class="font28">】&quot;.</span><span class="font49">The wider, brighter double</span><span class="font30">(</span><span class="font49">o the&nbsp;north is oriented about 90° from Struve 737, and (if you let your mind&nbsp;relax) it looks closer but really is not. Ifs just smoke and mirrors.</span></p>
<p class="font49">Now return to low power. At 23 x, M36 shares the same wide-field view with M38. Place the two clusters so that they are on the northeast&nbsp;edge of a wide-field eyepiece, so you can see 5th-magnitude Phi (&lt;J&gt;<span class="font30">)</span><span class="font49">&nbsp;Aurigae and its attendant stars forming a triangle with them 1%° to the&nbsp;west-southwest. Now sweep the telescope generously back and forth,&nbsp;moving first northeast to southwest, then northwest to southeast. Can&nbsp;you make out the lines of 8th- and 9th-magnitude stars connecting the&nbsp;clusters to one another and to Phi? These stars encompass a delta ofMilky&nbsp;V\^y, which shines with the misty glow of countless faint suns, tiny clusters, and patches of nebulosity It is one of the most rewarding views for&nbsp;rich-field telescopes in the northern skies. Large binoculars will also do&nbsp;justice to this region. Bumham found the cluster makes its best impression in 6- and 8-inch telescopes at 20 x to 60 x.</span></p><div>

The stream pours into M37, a solitary pool of subtle&nbsp;beauty Put down the binoculars and you should be able to pinpoint the&nbsp;open cluster's 5.6-magnitude glow with the naked eye. It is a small cluster&nbsp;(15'), so its light is compact. Telescopically; M37 is much more wonderful&nbsp;a sight than either M36 or M38. After looking at the two other clusters,&nbsp;</span><span class="font48" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">M37's</span><span class="font49"> grandeur took me by surprise. At 23 X this cluster looks like a finely&nbsp;resolved globular cluster - a marvelous illusion. Indeed, Luginbuhl and&nbsp;Skiff likened it to a &quot;broken down view&quot; of M22 or Omega (3) Centauri,&nbsp;and these are two of the greatest globulars in the night sky. The 200-millioyear-old cluster contains some 1,890 members. About 500 of&nbsp;these suns are brighter than 15th magnitude, and they are spread across&nbsp;15<sup>Z</sup> (about 20 light years of space).</span></p>
<p class="font49">Anyone who likes gemstones should appreciate M37, a 9th-magni-tude topaz jewel surrounded by a pear-shaped cluster of scintillating diamonds. Smyth called it a &quot;magnificent object; the whole field being strewn ... with sparkling gold dust.&quot; The color of the central star alone could mesmerize even the most tenured observer, though the degree of color perceived varies with the observer. Some have referred to it as ruby red&nbsp;(another gem!), others as simply red, still others as pale red. Could this star&nbsp;be variable? Someone with a photometer should try monitoring the&nbsp;brightness and color of this intriguing star over the course of a year.</p>
<p class="font49">I am surprised that I haven't encountered more references in the literature to the obvious dark lane slicing through the eastern half of the cluster's core. Luginbuhl and Skiff described it as a dark void about 5'&nbsp;across containing a single 12th-magnitude star. In this fashion, the pear-shaped diamond really looks more like a coat of arms. To enhance the dark&nbsp;lane's visual impact, slightly defocus the telescope. I have also seen this&nbsp;feature in photographs; try holding the photograph on page 126 at arms&nbsp;length and squinting.</p>
<p class="font49">At moderate magnification M37 is gloriously detailed. Its stellar richness accounts for only half of the clusters beauty, though. The other half is the vast network of dark lanes, which, at least from dark skies, becomes&nbsp;visually overpowering the longer I stare at the cluster. When I relax my&nbsp;gaze, the stars seem to fade into the background, while the dark lanes&nbsp;move forward. At that point, I feel as if I'm looking at the silhouettes of&nbsp;leafless trees against a sparkling expanse of Milky Way. If my eye jumps&nbsp;around the field, dark lines appear to slash across the cluster from all&nbsp;directions; it's as if I'm looking at this cluster through a severely fractured&nbsp;eyepiece. The illusion is even more dramatic than that of the dusty&nbsp;cobwebs covering M4.</p>
<p class="font49">If you consider the &quot;legs&quot; of stars extending north and south from M37*s pear-shaped body, the cluster mimics the shape of a water strider&nbsp;insect in a puddle of rain, as my drawing depicts. I suspect these legs represent part of the &quot;wonderful loops and curved lines of stars&quot; seen by&nbsp;Rosse.</p><div><img src="Deep-sky companions the Messier objects by Stephen James OMeara (z-lib_files/Deep-sky companions the Messier objects by Stephen James OMeara (z-lib-113.jpg" style="width:248pt;height:156pt;"/></div><br clear="all">
<p class="font49">About 2° northwest of M36 and faintly visible to the naked eye is the third Messier open cluster in Auriga, M38. At 15' in diameter, M38 is one-third&nbsp;larger than M36 in apparent size; it is also a half-magnitude fainter, independent of size. Surprisingly, M38 also has twice the number of stars that&nbsp;M36 has. M38 is one of the older galactic clusters and contains about 120&nbsp;stars in an area equal to half the diameter of the full moon. The density of&nbsp;its loosely packed center is about 8 stars per cubic parsec - half the density&nbsp;ofM36*s core and only one-fifth that of M37's.</p>
<p class="font49">About a dozen of the brightest scars in M38 are arranged in a distinct cross at the center of the cluster. Webb saw this first as an oblique cross&nbsp;with a pair of brighter stars in each arm, a view that reminds me of a silver&nbsp;crucifix studded with jewels. This is most obvious at high power. Look&nbsp;carefully and you will see a ring of stars at the center of the cross within&nbsp;which shines a solitary llth-magnitude star (dimmer stars can be seen&nbsp;but they are not obvious). A fainter ellipse of stars surrounds the cross,&nbsp;and. with imagination, I can see the arms of the cross wrapped around a&nbsp;hemispherical shell. This evokes a strong image of the bleached shell of a&nbsp;sea urchin seen at a slightly oblique angle, as shown in my drawing.</p>
<p class="font49">A ring of bright stars connects M38 to NGC 1907, a compressed 8th-magnitude open cluster 30' to the south-southwest. (Interestingly, this connection is not obvious at moderate to high powers or in small fields of&nbsp;view.) It doesn't take much imagination to at least contemplate M38 and&nbsp;NGC 1907 as being one cluster with a mighty void at the center (remember&nbsp;the black heart of M35?). I like to imagine I am looking at an aerial view of a&nbsp;galactic impact site, as if some hideously large comet once collided</p><div>

At least three of&nbsp;its brightest members can be distinguished with the unaided eye, and 7 x&nbsp;35 binoculars easily resolve about a dozen stars in an area of sky the size of&nbsp;the full Moon. Smyth seemed pleased with this venerable 300-million-year-old cluster, calling it a &quot;splashy field of stars in a rich vicinity&quot;</p>

I do wonder about&nbsp;Flammarion^ description: &quot;unusual curved runners of stars, with a compressed cluster of 20 stars, difficult to separate from the rest.&quot; My guess is&nbsp;that he based his comment on a binocular view, because I too have&nbsp;noticed one significant curve of stars running through that triangle in&nbsp;binoculars.</p>
<p class="font49">Meanwhile, use low power to survey the area around M39. Do you notice anything curious? Look outward from each of the triangle's three&nbsp;corners and you will find a tiny asterism of stars. Together the three asterisms form a perfect triangular encasement for the smaller triangle ofM39.</p><div><img src="Deep-sky companions the Messier objects by Stephen James OMeara (z-lib_files/Deep-sky companions the Messier objects by Stephen James OMeara (z-lib-118.jpg" style="width:245pt;height:169pt;"/></div><br clear="all">
<p class="font49">There is nothing astronomically significant about M40, except that it is a historical curiosity In 1660 John Hevelius reported **a nebula above the&nbsp;back*' of Ursa Major. This nebula is now widely accepted to be nothing&nbsp;more than a double star that must have appeared nebulous in Hevelius's&nbsp;&quot;old, imperfect instrument/' as Flammarion pointed out. Messier, too,&nbsp;reported trying to find a nebula at the coordinates given by Hevelius, but&nbsp;identified only two stars. Although he was not fooled by them, for some&nbsp;reason he still decided to include the pair in his catalogue. The nebulous&nbsp;appearance of a close double should not be surprising to anyone who has&nbsp;swept the Milky Way with binoculars or a rich-field telescope. Close pairings of stars often look like comets, especially at low magnifications.</p>
<p class="font49">Ironically, Flammarion based his conclusion on observations of a different double than the one Messier encountered in his search for the&nbsp;Hevelius nebula. And Smyth did the same! Confusing the matter further is&nbsp;that, when precessed, the position of Hevelius's nebula coincides with the&nbsp;position of the star 74 Ursa Majoris, which is not even double!</p>
<p class="font49">Regardless, Mallas verified that the object Messier observed and catalogued isWinnecke 4, a double star rediscovered in 1863 by A. Winnecke at Pulkova Observatory in Russia. And because that double is the one&nbsp;recorded in the Messier catalogue, it is the one we will locate.</p>
<p class="font49">Winnecke 4 is easily found about northeast of 70 Ursa Majoris, near Delta <span class="font30">⑹</span><span class="font49"> in the bowl of the Big Dipper.

<p class="font49">As Canis Major, the Great Dog of Orion, rises above cool winter landscapes, open cluster M41 hangs below its collar like an ice-covered tag reflecting moonlight. One of the faintest objects recorded in classical&nbsp;history, M41 was seen by Aristotle as a star with a tail. With the naked eye, I</p>
<p class="font49">find it surprisingly similar to the Beehive Cluster (M44), only smaller. Virtually sitting on 6th-magnitude 12 Canis Majoris, about 4° south of&nbsp;Sirius (the brightest star in the night sky at magnitude -1.5), M41 shines at&nbsp;magnitude 4.5 and fills an area of sky 30 percent larger than the full moon.&nbsp;From nineteenth-century England, Webb hailed it as a &quot;superb group&nbsp;visible to the naked eye.&quot;</p><div>

<p class="font49">Unfortunately for many of today's observers, the naked-eye view is not as superb, or even possible, thanks to light pollution. But if you do&nbsp;enjoy dark skies, M41 looks to the naked eye like a ghost image of Sirius, or&nbsp;a falling dump of snow illuminated by Sirius's fire-fused crystal blaze. In&nbsp;7X35 binoculars, both Sirius and M41 fit in the field of view, and binoculars resolve the cluster quite well. But even with the unaided eye I get the&nbsp;distinct impression of resolution - a provocative sight, because of the 80&nbsp;or so stars in this 100-million-year-old cluster, about 50 shine between 7th&nbsp;and 13th magnitude; at least three of them are 7th magnitude, and seven&nbsp;others are 8th magnitude. I think that after several observations over time,&nbsp;an astute observer could resolve some individual stars with the unaided&nbsp;eye. The stars in M41 are spread across about 25 light years, and the&nbsp;cluster's central density is a loose 6 stars per cubic parsec.</p>
<p class="font49">The first thing I notice in the telescope is a pair of equally bright red stars in the center of the cluster. But this observation is rather enigmatic,&nbsp;considering that most accounts refer to a <span class="font49" style="font-style:italic;">single</span><span class="font49"> red star there. Webb saw&nbsp;&quot;larger stars in a curve with ruddy star near centre.&quot; Jones described a&nbsp;&quot;central, slightly orange star,&quot; and Mallas referred to it as the &quot;famous red&nbsp;star at the center.&quot; Burnham notes that the &quot;central reddish star<sup>M</sup> is a Type-Kgiant, and that several otherl\pe-Kgiants are known in the cluster. The&nbsp;central star may also be variable. I compared my drawing of M41 (with&nbsp;two central red stars) with the drawing by Jones (with one central red star)&nbsp;in </span><span class="font49" style="font-style:italic;">Messier's Nebulae and Star Clusters.</span><span class="font49"> Interestingly, I can identify my&nbsp;second red star due east of Jones's single red star. But he drew it markedly&nbsp;fainter!</span></p>
<p class="font49">Curiously, Smyth writes of M41: &quot;A double star in a scattered cluster.... 49, lucid white, BIO, pale white.&quot; He could have been referring&nbsp;to a double star on the western edge of the cluster, as Jones believed. But if&nbsp;so, (hen the prosaic Smyth, who often refers to spectacularly colored stars&nbsp;in clusters, apparently did not notice any predominantly red stars in M41.</p>
<p class="font49">Using my imagination, I can see the pattern of bright stars in M41 outlining a fruit bat, or flying fox. The bat's wings are slightly opened in a&nbsp;curve. The bat is hanging by a branch (which flying foxes do), and 12 Canis&nbsp;Majoris makes a tempting piece of fruit for the bat to eye. This pattern can&nbsp;also be made out in 7 x 35 binoculars. At 72 x the entire bat asterism fits&nbsp;perfectly in the field of view. But because of its larger apparent size, the</p><img src="Deep-sky companions the Messier objects by Stephen James OMeara (z-lib_files/Deep-sky companions the Messier objects by Stephen James OMeara (z-lib-121.jpg" style="width:249pt;height:454pt;"/>
<p class="font49">asterism loses some of its impact. The stars do stand out more boldly though, and the dark rifts between the stars seem to slither across like&nbsp;blacksnakes. The cluster suddenly appears loosely gathered into groups&nbsp;of stars that form triangles, arcs, lines, and other geometrical patterns, as&nbsp;if in a cataclysmic explosion, with celestial debris flying off in various&nbsp;directions.</p><div><img src="Deep-sky companions the Messier objects by Stephen James OMeara (z-lib_files/Deep-sky companions the Messier objects by Stephen James OMeara (z-lib-122.jpg" style="width:242pt;height:316pt;"/></div><br clear="all"><div>

<p class="font49">One of the greatest paradoxes in visual astronomy is that Galileo (who paid great attention to Orion, according to Webb) apparently never&nbsp;noticed the Great Nebula. Furthermore, there appears to be no mention&nbsp;of it in medieval records. Yet here is one of the grandest naked-eye&nbsp;nebulae in the heavens, dangling from one of the best-known asterisms&nbsp;(Orion*s Belt) in one of the most famous and brilliant constellations. That</p><img src="Deep-sky companions the Messier objects by Stephen James OMeara (z-lib_files/Deep-sky companions the Messier objects by Stephen James OMeara (z-lib-124.png" style="width:170pt;height:132pt;"/>
<p class="font49">Galileo would have missed seeing it is especially puzzling given that AJ-Sufi and others had noticed the fainter &quot;nebula&quot; in Andromeda (M31) as early as A.D. 905! Messier also miscredits Huygens with the discovery of&nbsp;the Orion Nebula, apparently unaware of the earlier observations made&nbsp;by Peiresc and others. But even Huygens's words should alarm modem ■&nbsp;day observers: &quot;There is one phenomenon among the fixed stars worthy&nbsp;of mention, which as far as I know, has hitherto been unnoticed by no one&nbsp;and indeed, <span class="font49" style="font-style:italic;">cannot be well observed except with large telescopes^&nbsp;</span><span class="font49">(Emphasis is mine.)</span></p>
<p class="font49">Yet, in how many New England winters have I looked across snowladen fields to see this nebula, in the middle of Orion's sword, looking like angel's breath against a frosted sky.

<p class="font49">How can anyone draw the Orion Nebula and do it justice?

If you&nbsp;concentrate solely on the dark bay and forget the nebulosity, a powerfully&nbsp;dark image appears. It is a mighty silhouette and you can follow its course&nbsp;throughout the entire region. The faint nebulosity forming the bay's</p><img src="Deep-sky companions the Messier objects by Stephen James OMeara (z-lib_files/Deep-sky companions the Messier objects by Stephen James OMeara (z-lib-125.png" style="width:248pt;height:187pt;"/>
<p class="font49">northern bank appears to have turbulent edges near the Trapezium. And its pale gray color and soft texture are so unlike the stronger green wreathlike nebulosity in the main body of M42. The Orion Nebula is one of the&nbsp;few gaseous clouds that shows color through amateur telescopes.&nbsp;Photographers have no problem recording vivid reds and greens in it with&nbsp;proper exposures. Of course, Hubble images depict a full spectrum of&nbsp;vibrant colors throughout the nebula. Our eyes, on the other hand, are&nbsp;largely insensitive to color at night. So visual observers have to settle for&nbsp;subtle shades of green or red. Interestingly, when we do see these colors,&nbsp;pale as they might be, our minds tend to exaggerate their intensity, and we&nbsp;say the color is &quot;strong,&quot; as I did above.</p>
<p class="font49">M43 is a wedge of nebulosity surrounding a 7th-magnitude star (called Bond's star) 10' northeast of theTrapezium. Commonly overlooked&nbsp;because of its proximity and association with the Orion Nebula, M43&nbsp;harbors a wealth of detail that is well worth becoming acquainted with, so&nbsp;plan an evening with it. You will have to block out the commanding presence of its larger neighbor, but one way to seclude M43 is to use high magnification. See if you can resolve the tiny dark pool due east of Bond's star.&nbsp;One night a short but strong earthquake struck while I was examining&nbsp;M43. The telescope began to shake and, when it did. my eye caught sight of&nbsp;some extremely faint extensions looping to the west and a long wedge of&nbsp;material flowing to the east. Instead of waiting for an earthquake, try&nbsp;tapping your telescope tube and see if you can make out these subtle features. Also, be sure to move north of M43 to NGC 1977, more nebulosity</p>
<p class="font49">whose wavy texture is delightful at low powers. Then move farther north to the loose open cluster NGC1981, to complete your tour of Orion's sword.</p>
<p class="font49">By the way, returning to M42 and the subject of challenges, I have also spent considerable time peering at the region just inside the Great&nbsp;Nebula's arcing western rim and searching for &quot;GOD&quot; - a series of dark&nbsp;nebulous swirls that spell out the word GOD in capital letters. Although I&nbsp;have seen portions of these letters, I have yet to piece together the details&nbsp;in a single strong view. This challenge might be a bit too difficult for the 4-inch, but I do urge those with larger telescopes to look for GOD in the&nbsp;Orion Nebula.</p><div>

In fact, if it weren't for the mystifying&nbsp;cloudy appearance of open cluster M44, which draws your gaze to the surrounding 4th-magnitude stars, it is conceivable that dim Cancer might&nbsp;have either gone unnoticed by ancient stargazers or have been envisioned&nbsp;differently.

The age of the cluster&nbsp;is estimated to be 400 million years, and its core measures 11 light years in&nbsp;diameter.</p>
<p class="font49">At first glance, M44 appears round to the naked eye, but if you con<span class="font30">・</span><span class="font49"> centrate, it should look elongated roughly north-south. You might also&nbsp;begin to suspect arms extending in various directions and stars shining&nbsp;within the central haze. Is M44 resolvable to the unaided eye? Yes, and it's&nbsp;not difficult to do! In fact, the cluster contains 15 stars between magnitudes 6.3 and 7.5. One night, while observing at 14,000 feet, I gazed at the&nbsp;Beehive without optical aid while occasionally breathing oxygen through&nbsp;an oxygen mask. To my amazement, the haze of unresolved stars vanished&nbsp;and the individual cluster members stood out boldly as rock-steady&nbsp;pearls, each tiny, bright disk surrounded by an intense black rim. I did not&nbsp;count the stars that night because they seemed so numerous. I used the&nbsp;oxygen in brief spurts to help keep me alert, because, at 14,000 feet, the&nbsp;atmosphere is 40 percent thinner than at sea level. Lack of oxygen can also&nbsp;decrease the sensitivity of the eyes. For example, without supplemental&nbsp;oxygen at 14,000 feet, I had to use averted vision to see the Andromeda&nbsp;Galaxy well; 10,000 feet lower, however, the galaxy was an incredible&nbsp;naked</span><span class="font30">・</span><span class="font49">eye sight with direct vision. There is no reason for sea-level&nbsp;observers to use additional oxygen, because you're working in an oxygenrich environment (hyperventilating, however, can increase the immediate supply); too much oxygen will make you sick. I did count the stars in&nbsp;M44 from 9,000 feet and 4,000 feet without oxygen. With a long, dedicated&nbsp;effort, I recorded a dozen cluster members without optical aid - that's&nbsp;twice the number of stars most observers </span><span class="font49" style="font-style:italic;">casually</span><span class="font49"> see in the Pleiades&nbsp;(M45)!</span></p>

<p class="font49">I would be curious to know how the celestial backdrop affects brightness estimates of open clusters in the Milky Way band. For example, one reason M44 appears so visually distinct is that its brilliant orb of starlight&nbsp;is seen against the star-poor region of Cancer, which is off the main stream&nbsp;of the Milky Way. It is seen projected against a darker background than,&nbsp;say, either M6 or M7, which are nestled in the most brilliant region of the&nbsp;Milky Way. I can only imagine how stunningly bright M7 would appear ifit&nbsp;were seen against the stars of Cancer and how dim M44 would appear if&nbsp;seen against the heart of the Milky Way!</p><div>

<p class="font49">On crisp winter evenings, this brilliant lst-magnitude open cluster rides high on the shoulder oflaurus the Bull, whose V-shaped face itself (minus&nbsp;Aldebaran) is another, brighter open cluster - the Hyades. Together these&nbsp;clusters are among the most alluring sights in the heavens. But, the larger.&nbsp;more open Hyades pales in comparison to magnificent M45. W<span class="font28">让</span><span class="font49">h the&nbsp;naked eye, the Pleiades looks like a tiny dipper, a forest of starlight bathed&nbsp;in moonlit mist, or a distant gathering of veiled brides. Indeed, photographs show the entire cluster swaddled in ice-blue nebulosity, which&nbsp;reflects the light of these young, hot stars. The stars of the Pleiades&nbsp;emerged from their dusty cocoon some 20 million years ago. And some&nbsp;astronomers have conjectured that rather than the surrounding nebula&nbsp;belonging to them, the stars may just be passing through a nebulous&nbsp;region in Taurus.</span></p>
<p class="font49">Just how many stars (Pleiads) in the Pleiades are truly visible with the naked eye is the subject of some debate. Traditionally, the number has&nbsp;been seven. But that count stems from ancient Greek mythology and&nbsp;refers to the seven doves that carried ambrosia to the infant Zeus, or to the&nbsp;seven sisters who were placed in the heavens so that they might forget&nbsp;their grief over the fate of their father, Atlas, condemned to support the sky&nbsp;on his shoulders. Although largely symbolic, the age-old association of the&nbsp;Pleiades with the number seven remains fixed to this day-to the point that&nbsp;some observers swear they cannot see more than seven members, even&nbsp;though the Pleiades contains <span class="font49" style="font-style:italic;">10 stars brighter than 6th magnitude.</span><span class="font49"> Some&nbsp;observers question how it is possible to see 10 Pleiads in the Seven Sisters&nbsp;(a demonstration of the power of words or, as Clerke inferred, the power of&nbsp;the Pleiades over human affairs.) The fact is that almost </span><span class="font49" style="font-style:italic;">three times</span><span class="font49"> that&nbsp;magic number of stars can be seen without magnification by an astute&nbsp;observer under dark skies. Clerke notes that Kepler's tutor, Maestlin, saw&nbsp;14, and he mapped 11 before the invention of the telescope. Archinal&nbsp;reports routinely seeing 12 Pleiads and sometimes 14 under good skies.&nbsp;Houston counted 1&amp; and about 20 years ago I logged 17 from Cambridge,&nbsp;Massachusetts! The trick is to spend a </span><span class="font49" style="font-style:italic;">lot</span><span class="font49"> of time looking and plotting.</span></p>
<p class="font49">Another lingering debate concerns whether the nebulosity associated with the cluster can be seen with the naked eye. Some argue that the haze is just an illusion, a vision created by the tight gathering of stars&nbsp;whose unresolved light simply <span class="font49" style="font-style:italic;">appears</span><span class="font49"> fuzzy - just as close doubles do at&nbsp;low power (like M40). Others, however, claim that the cluster appears just&nbsp;as Tennyson described it in </span><span class="font49" style="font-style:italic;">Locksley</span><span class="font49"> Ha</span><span class="font28">〃： </span><span class="font49">&quot;Many a night I saw the&nbsp;Pleiades, / rising thro' the mellow shade, / glitter like a swarm of fireflies /&nbsp;tangled in a silver braid.&quot; Houston once scoffed, &quot;Why does everyone fuss&nbsp;over the Pleiades nebulosity? Of course you can see it with the naked eye!°&nbsp;He went on to say something colorful about the naysayers. I did not reply,&nbsp;and he didn't expect a response; he knew he was preaching to the choir.&nbsp;However, Skiff points out that some of the perceived nebulosity may be&nbsp;scattered starlight. He suggests testing this hypothesis by screening&nbsp;Alcyone, the brightest Pleiad, behind the edge of a building.

<p class="font49">The 70-million-year-old cluster contains about 100 stars in a sphere 14 light years in diameter. It is sailing through space at about 25 miles per&nbsp;second, and it will take them about 30,000 years to move an apparent distance of one moon diameter. The brightest Pleiads are all rapidly rotating,&nbsp;with Pleione spinning about 100 times faster than our sun. And Alcyone,&nbsp;the centralmost and brightest Pleiad, is a thousand times more luminous&nbsp;that the sun.</p>
<p class="font49">Through a telescope the Pleiades and its attendant nebulosity fill a low-power field, where they are best seen. The nine brightest members fit&nbsp;well in a 1° field (a true diameter of 7 light years). From dark skies, the&nbsp;cluster looks like a cobwebbed coffin filled with glistening jewels. The&nbsp;individual Pleiads are interconnected by gauzelike veils of nebulosity, the&nbsp;brightest of which surrounds the star Merope (23 Tauri), and is called the&nbsp;Merope Nebula (IC349).</p>
<p class="font49">Just south of Merope is a condensation of nebulosity, NGC1435, also known as &quot;Tempel's Nebula,&quot; which was first noticed in 1859 byW. Tempel&nbsp;with a 4-inch refractor. He described it as a faint stain of fog, like a **breath&nbsp;on a mirror/* In 1874 Lewis Swift saw it in a 2-inch refractor at 25x. One&nbsp;century later Houston used an 8-inch reflector from southern Arizona to&nbsp;see the field laced from edge to edge with bright wreaths of delicately&nbsp;structured nebulosity. Interestingly, the great double-star observer S. W.&nbsp;Burnham could not see this nebulosity with the great 18-inch refractor at&nbsp;Dearborn Observatory in Illinois. But faint, diffuse glows can evade large-aperture telescopes.</p>
<p class="font49">At first glance the Merope Nebula network looks like a tapered comet tail. But if you take the time to sweep the telescope back and forth over <span class="font28">让</span><span class="font49">s&nbsp;surroundings, you might notice that this patch is but part of a larger fan of&nbsp;material that sweeps westward. Using low magnification, just stare at the&nbsp;cluster for a while and occasionally tap the telescope tube. You should&nbsp;start to see wide dark lanes running amid the nebulosity, especially at the&nbsp;cluster's center, where it drapes around a bridal veil of nebulosity adorning Alcyone. Study the drawing and photograph and look for prominent&nbsp;streaks of nebulosity, especially around Maia and Electra.</span></p><div>

<p><span class="font48" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">ngc: Remarkable cluster, very rich, bright, and large,&nbsp;involving a planetary nebula.</span></p></div><br clear="all">
<p class="font49">Use your binoculars and scan about 15° (a fist- and two finger-widths) cast of Sirius in a line due south ofProcyon and Alpha (a) Monocerotis. There,&nbsp;hiding among the monotonously faint star fields of the Puppis Milky Way,&nbsp;are the curious Messier open clusters M46 and M47. They lie a mere (a&nbsp;finger-width) apart but look markedly different. The farther east of the&nbsp;two, M46, is a relatively young galactic star cluster with an age of 300&nbsp;million years; it appears like a round, uniform 6th-magn<span class="font28">让</span><span class="font49">ude glow.&nbsp;Gawky M47, on the other hand, is an irregular gathering of reasonably&nbsp;bright but dissimilar stars; the Cluster's young age (about 55 million years)&nbsp;places it in the same age category as the Pleiades. And though both clusters have impressive apparent diameters three-quarters the size of the full&nbsp;moon, their wildly different appearances can distract you from that realization. What is immediately obvious, however, even in binoculars, is that&nbsp;whatever M46 lacks in visual grandeur, M47 lacks in visual grace, and vice&nbsp;versa. It*s like trying to compare a flower with a rock.</span></p>
<p class="font49">At 23 x, M46 is a bright sphere of finely resolved starlight with faint, clockwise spiral structure. If you sweep the telescope to the west, you&nbsp;might notice that M46 appears to be on the eastern end of a wide, V-shaped string of 9th-magnitude stars connecting it to M47. But this is&nbsp;deceptive: M46 is 3,750 light years more distant than M47 and is actually&nbsp;somewhat larger than its closer neighbor! M46 contains 186 stars ranging&nbsp;from magnitude 10 to 13 distributed rather evenly over an area of 20' with&nbsp;a loose central gathering. But this central gathering is also somewhat illusory, because moderate to high magnification will reveal that M46 has a&nbsp;dark, not a bright, core. With imagination, I see that void as an atoll, with a&nbsp;2<sup>Z</sup>-diameter black lake rimmed by lOth-magnitude coral specks that&nbsp;break a wave of stars flowing around it from the south.</p>
<p class="font49">There is yet another illusion associated with M46. It appears to contain a tiny planetary nebula, NGC 2438, which is distinctly visible in&nbsp;the accompanying photograph. But the cluster and nebula are not physically associated, because the cluster is 5,300 light years distant whereas&nbsp;the nebula's distance has been a matter of debate. Estimates have placed&nbsp;it about 6&gt;520 light years distant (making it farther away than the cluster)&nbsp;to about 3,000 light years away, placing it roughly half way between M46&nbsp;and M47. NGC 2438 started to form about 45,000 years ago. In a 1996&nbsp;<span class="font49" style="font-style:italic;">Astronomische Nachrichten</span><span class="font49"> (vol. 317, no. 6, p. 413.) paper, however, R.&nbsp;Pauls and L. Kohoutek write that they determined the recessional velocity&nbsp;of NGC 2438 to be about 37 miles per second, which is in agreement with&nbsp;the recessional velocity of 4 stars in M46 (38 miles per second). &quot;We conclude,<sup>n</sup> the authors write, &quot;that contrary to earlier statements the nebula&nbsp;is probably associated with the cluster.&quot; Positioned just a few arc minutes&nbsp;north of the cluster's center, this 11 th-magnitude planetary measures&nbsp;only about </span><span class="font49" style="font-style:italic;">V</span><span class="font49"> in diameter. I suspected it at 23 x, but 72 x shows it clearly&nbsp;as a ghostly mote among the multitude. With averted vision at high power,&nbsp;it looks like the glow from the flame of a distant candle. Try, if you must,&nbsp;for the planetary's central star, but the task might be daunting, given that&nbsp;it shines at about 16th magnitude! Finally, turn your gaze north of the&nbsp;planetary. Do you see the wide canal in the cluster's outer halo of faint&nbsp;stars? It runs southwest to northeast, and its southern bank abuts the&nbsp;planetary.</span></p>

<p class="font49">and 0.4-magnitude Alpha (a) Canis Majoris, and lies only 3%° southwest of the obvious naked-eye grouping of 1,2, and c Hydrae.</p>
<p class="font49">Messier's recorded position for M48 is off by about 5° in declination, placing it due north of NGC 2548 (where there are no clusters).&nbsp;Astronomical historian Owen Gingerich, in his chapter in the 1978 classic,&nbsp;<span class="font49" style="font-style:italic;">The Messier Album,</span><span class="font49"> explained:</span></p>
<p class="font49">Messier determined the declination of a nebula or cluster by measuring the difference between the object and a comparison&nbsp;star of known declination.... Since no conspicuous star is located&nbsp;2%° away in declination, we cannot account for this position by&nbsp;another error in sign [as was the case with M47].... Messier did not&nbsp;publish the name of the [comparison] star he used, and his original&nbsp;records are apparently no longer extant.... Thus, a careful survey&nbsp;of the region described by Messier leads to the conclusion that&nbsp;NGC 2548 is the duster that the French observer intended as his&nbsp;48th object, for lack of any other cluster nearby that fits the&nbsp;description.</p>
<p class="font49">Although I agree with Gingerich that NGC 2548 is the most likely candidate for M4&amp; I must also relate the following experience.</p>
<p class="font49">When I went out to make my first observation ofM48 for this book, 1 began by looking for the cluster with the unaided eye. I easily located the&nbsp;line of stars 1, 2, and c Hydrae, and then immediately noticed a diffuse&nbsp;patch south of them. I swung the telescope to this region and swept the&nbsp;area at 23 x. To my amazement, I could not find the cluster. I looked up&nbsp;again, located the hazy patch, and tried to find the cluster, but without&nbsp;success. Then I realized my mistake, I was looking too far to the southeast.&nbsp;I moved the telescope 5° northwest and - <span class="font49" style="font-style:italic;">bang-</span><span class="font49"> there was M48.</span></p>
<p class="font49">I didn't think anything of this experience until I repeated that very same mistake the next time I went out! Thafs when I noticed <span class="font49" style="font-style:italic;">two</span><span class="font49"> naked-eye glows south of 1,2, and c Hydrae: one is about 3%° southeast of them,&nbsp;the other is about 3Z° southwest of them; they are separated by about 5°.&nbsp;Furthermore, M48 is the </span><span class="font49" style="font-style:italic;">fainter</span><span class="font49"> of these two naked-eye patches! There is&nbsp;another geometrical similarity M48 marks the southern apex of a triangle&nbsp;with c Hydrae and Zeta </span><span class="font28">(【)</span><span class="font49">Monocerotis to the northwest, whereas the&nbsp;nameless patch forms the southern apex of a triangle with c Hydrae and&nbsp;31 Monocerotis to the southeast.</span></p>
<p class="font49">I viewed this mystery cloud through the 4-inch at 23 x and found it to be a loose collection of similarly bright stars. When I placed it in my 7 x&nbsp;35 binoculars and slightly defocused the view, I saw a small &quot;fuzzy&quot; object&nbsp;(the unresolved loose gathering of stars in the mystery cloud) surrounded&nbsp;by a brighter circlet of stars (giving the cloud brightness and breadth).&nbsp;Could this curious object have been Messier's real 48th entry?</p>
<p class="font49">Through the 4-inch, M48 is a tremendously pleasing cluster, a perfect arrowhead of bright stars with a tight, elliptical, off-axis core. Like&nbsp;Rosse, I find the cluster riddled with dark lanes and openings. One dark&nbsp;feature I call the &quot;keyhole&quot; - it's a notch in the base of the arrow to the&nbsp;southwest. Actually, I like to call M48 the &quot;alligator,&quot; because, it reminds&nbsp;me of an aerial view of a stalking alligator (when all one sees is its triangular head and snout). With this image in mind, I see a wake of stars flowing&nbsp;around the snout, and, to the northeast&gt; a circle of stars representing a&nbsp;turtle - an alligator's favorite meal.</p><div><img src="Deep-sky companions the Messier objects by Stephen James OMeara (z-lib_files/Deep-sky companions the Messier objects by Stephen James OMeara (z-lib-136.jpg" style="width:148pt;height:248pt;"/></div><br clear="all">

In the early 1990s, ROSAT (an earth-orbiting x-ray observatory)&nbsp;imaged M49 and revealed it to possess a halo of hot (10,000,000 K) gas.&nbsp;Observations with previous x-ray telescopes have shown that the hot gas&nbsp;in galaxy clusters cannot be confined by the combined gravity of the gas&nbsp;and the galaxies alone. Thus, the ROSAT data imply that perhaps 75 to 95&nbsp;percent of the mass of small galaxy clusters, such as the M49 subcluster,&nbsp;could be in the form of dark matter. It has also been discovered that ellipti -cal galaxies that He at the center of galaxy clusters lack the raw materials&nbsp;from which new stars form, so the ellipticals are excessively red.</span></p>

<p class="font49">galaxy's bright eastern fringe like a splendid supernova. The overall sight reminds me of an unresolved globular cluster or the head of a comet.&nbsp;Barnabus Oriani, an Italian observer of the eighteenth century, thought&nbsp;the haze looked exactly like the comet of 1779 (apparently, so did Messier).</p>
<p class="font49">But look carefully at the nucleus with high power. I get hints of inner structure, namely, a mottled nuclear region and two arcs of light at the&nbsp;outer edge of the inner halo, one to the northeast, the other to the southwest; they also appear mottled and cause me to suspect spiral structure,&nbsp;though this may be an illusion. D<sup>F</sup>Arrest, however, believed he resolved&nbsp;the misty glow ofM49 into stars of 13th to 14th magnitude near the edges.&nbsp;Speaking of illusions, do you see a cross of faint knots or stars bordering&nbsp;the bright inner region? It resembles the gravitational-lensing effect&nbsp;known as Einstein's Cross. The visible outer envelope itself is very deceiving: at high power, it makes the galaxy appear round, but moderate to low&nbsp;magnifications reveal a broad shield of diffuseness that transforms this&nbsp;sphere into an elliptical glow oriented northeast to southwest.</p>
<p class="font49">When using the telescope, refer to the detailed finder chart for M49 to scan the area, because, as I quickly discovered, the low-power field is&nbsp;chock full of galaxies, and theyre all pleasantly distracting. The most&nbsp;prominent of them is NGC 4526, another elliptical about 1° southeast of&nbsp;M49, between two 7th-magnitude stars.</p><div>

<p><span class="font48" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">ngc: Remarkable cluster, very large, rich, pretty compressed,&nbsp;elongated. The stars range&nbsp;from 12th to 16th magnitude.</span></p>
<p class="font49">M50, an obscure open cluster in an equally obscure constellation (Monoceros), has an aura of enigma about it. Giovanni Domenico Cassini,&nbsp;father of Jean Dominique Cassini (who discovered the first gap in Saturns&nbsp;rings in 1675), appears to have chanced upon this object before 1711. But&nbsp;this fact was only related by his son in his <span class="font49" style="font-style:italic;">Elements of Astronomy,</span><span class="font49"> where he&nbsp;mentions his father sighting a nebula in the area between Canis Major&nbsp;and Canis Minor. Messier looked for the object in 1771 but did not find it,&nbsp;concluding that the elder Cassini had probably witnessed a passing&nbsp;comet. One year later, however, Messier did sweep up an open cluster in&nbsp;Monoceros that was to become the 50th entry in his catalogue.</span></p>
<p class="font49">You can use binoculars to locate M50. It will appear as a bright 6th-magnitude glow bathed in a rich Milky Way field just 7° north of Gamma (7) Canis Majoris - a 4th-magnitude star about 5° (two finger-widths) east&nbsp;of Sirius. Once you've found this snowy blur, lower the binoculars and try&nbsp;to see it with the naked eye. This might be a challenge if your skies are at all&nbsp;light polluted.</p>
<p class="font49">At low power the cluster's true extent is rather hard to make out,</p><img src="Deep-sky companions the Messier objects by Stephen James OMeara (z-lib_files/Deep-sky companions the Messier objects by Stephen James OMeara (z-lib-138.jpg" style="width:249pt;height:332pt;"/>
<p class="font49">because the Milky Way surrounding M50 is bursting with stellar clumps and asterisms. Indeed, Skiff says it is hard even to determine M50's decli<span class="font30">・</span><span class="font49">&nbsp;nation because of irregular concentrations of stars in the immediate&nbsp;vicinity. Wallenquist found at least 50 members in the central 14'of the&nbsp;cluster, and Skiff counts 150 members across 25'in a 10-inch telescope.&nbsp;Archinal tallies only 80 cluster members in a 14'diameter, though. The&nbsp;question is. Where does the cluster really end?</span></p>
<p class="font49">With moderate magnification, the main pattern of stars forms a crude cross whose broken arms extend nearly 1° on a side. These prominent but star-poor arms radiate from the cluster's bleak center; they&nbsp;would make a striking spiral pattern, except that one of the arms is&nbsp;“turning&quot; the wrong way. But, again, are these long stellar extensions part&nbsp;of the true cluster? If you cut back to low power and look at the cluster's&nbsp;overall shape, you will see fainter stars filling in the gaps between the&nbsp;arms, giving the cluster a distinctly oval appearance, though it is just&nbsp;slightly out of round. M50's shape reminds me of Omega Centauri's.</p>
<p class="font49">Now concentrate on the heart of the cluster. Do you see a distinct right-angle pattern of stars with a curved hypotenuse to the east? A&nbsp;smaller cluster of stars resides in the northern section of that warped right&nbsp;triangle. This minicluster contains about a dozen members that form a&nbsp;scooplike asterism. Apparently, Luginbuhl and Skiff noticed this grouping&nbsp;too, observing that &quot;the middle of the cluster is relatively empty except for&nbsp;one small group.&quot; They also recorded a dark patch near the cluster's&nbsp;center, which is probably why M50*s heart looks so empty. The stars of&nbsp;M50 are slightly reddened, implying some obscuration by dust along our&nbsp;line of sight.</p>
<p class="font49">Many observers over the past century and earlier have commented on a red star in the southern portion of the cluster; Smyth, d'Arrest, and&nbsp;Webb all noted it. But I did not see it, nor did Mallas, who wrote, &quot;A red star&nbsp;mentioned by Admiral Smyth and T.W Webb is presumably the 8th-magnitude object about 7'south of the cluster's center, but the color was not&nbsp;conspicuous to Indeed, Skiff notes that photometry of this magni-tude-7.8 star on the southern edge shows it to be definitely red. Could the&nbsp;discrepancy be because this star is a variable? Or, does it just reflect individual differences in color perception of faint objects? Archinal viewed the&nbsp;star with a 20-inch f/7 reflector and described <span class="font28">让 </span><span class="font49">as “particularly bright&nbsp;orange.&quot; He suspects the reported variations in the star's color are due to&nbsp;variations in observers' eyes, particularly at low light levels.</span></p>
<p class="font49">Use low power to follow a meandering river of 9th- to lOth-magni-tude stars flowing south of M50. It is even more striking in binoculars, looking like a fuzzy strand of DNA. It winds its way toward another weak&nbsp;and loose open cluster, NGC 2335,2° to the southwest.</p><img src="Deep-sky companions the Messier objects by Stephen James OMeara (z-lib_files/Deep-sky companions the Messier objects by Stephen James OMeara (z-lib-139.jpg" style="width:44pt;height:53pt;"/><img src="Deep-sky companions the Messier objects by Stephen James OMeara (z-lib_files/Deep-sky companions the Messier objects by Stephen James OMeara (z-lib-140.jpg" style="width:18pt;height:21pt;"/><div>

<p class="font49">Just as the Crab Nebula, Ml, caused Messier to undertake his catalogue, the Whirlpool Galaxy, M51, caused me to undertake my own version ofhis&nbsp;catalogue. My reason for starting, though, was different from Messier's. He&nbsp;would have preferred that you avoid the objects in his list, whereas I'm&nbsp;encouraging you to seek them out!</p>
<p class="font49">Once believed to be a great swirling nebula, M51 is now known to be the finest example of a face-on spiral galaxy A near neighbor of our own&nbsp;galaxy, just 15 million light years away, this graceful pinwheel of stars,&nbsp;dust, and gas measures about 50,000 light years across and shines with the&nbsp;luminosity of about 10 billion suns. Rosse detected the nebula's **spiral&nbsp;convulsions&quot; in 1845 with his 72-inch speculum mirror reflector, making&nbsp;M51 the first galaxy shown to have spiral structure. Some eighteenth- and&nbsp;nineteenth-century observers, such as John Herschel, were nearly clairvoyant about the object's nature. Herschel's drawing ofM51 shows a split&nbsp;ring surrounding a central condensation, a view that closely resembled&nbsp;his concept of the Milky Way's structure. Smyth went so far as to describe&nbsp;the nebula as a &quot;stellar universe, similar to that to which we belong, whose&nbsp;vast amplitudes are in no doubt peopled with countless numbers of percipient beings.&quot; But these statements were based on the knowledge of the&nbsp;day; the astronomers did not envision a galaxy of countless suns but&nbsp;rather a hazy vortex that verified the cosmology established by the French&nbsp;mathematician Pierre Simon de Laplace, who postulated that our solar&nbsp;system condensed out of a rotating gaseous nebula. This notion of M51&nbsp;being a solar system in formation was not shattered until 1923, when&nbsp;astronomers discovered the true nature of the mysterious spiral nebulae.</p>
<p class="font49">M51 is easily spotted in binoculars, glowing at 8th magnitude 3%° southwest of Eta (q) Ursa Majoris, the end of the Big Dipper's handle. As</p><div>
<p class="font49">my drawing indicates, M51 does not reveal much detail in small telescopes. But the features I did record are impressive for a 4-inch telescope. For example, the galaxy's main spiral arms are often stated as being diffi-</p><img src="Deep-sky companions the Messier objects by Stephen James OMeara (z-lib_files/Deep-sky companions the Messier objects by Stephen James OMeara (z-lib-141.png" style="width:250pt;height:33pt;"/>
<p class="font49">have shied away from at least suggesting the possibility that M51 had</p></div><br clear="all">
<p class="font49">spiral structure. The brightest portions of the arms do appear mottled and are clearly separated from the stellar nucleus and its tightly wound core by&nbsp;dusky patches (this is the &quot;ring&quot; Herschel and others saw). I would have&nbsp;agreed with Smyth, who saw M51 as &quot;resembling the ghost of Saturn with&nbsp;its rings in a vertical position.&quot;</p>
<p class="font49">Messier saw M51 as a double nebula whose &quot;atmospheres&quot; were touching one another. Why, then, didn't he catalogue each bright component separately, as he did for M42 and M43, and for M31 and M32?</p>
<p class="font49">Perhaps because of M5Ts small apparent size compared to the mighty Orion Nebula or Andromeda Galaxy. Or was it because theWliirlpool and&nbsp;what is now known to be its companion galaxy, 9.5-magnitude NGC5195,&nbsp;4'<span class="font30">(</span><span class="font49">o the north, appeared more like a single entity than two distinct ones,&nbsp;perhaps because of an unsteady atmosphere.</span></p>
<p class="font49">Admittedly, the most surprising detail in my drawing is the dim bridge of gas connecting M51 to NGC 5195. The visibility of this bridge in&nbsp;small apertures has long been debated. Some argue it cannot be seen&nbsp;except from under a dark sky and with at least a 12-inch telescope. Others&nbsp;say it can be seen in a 4-inch. Could the view of the bridge in small apertures be illusory - a manifestation created by the proximity of the two&nbsp;galaxies coupled with the knowledge that the bridge exists? 1 did an exper</p>

<p class="font49">As I mentioned in chapter 2, the nineteenth-century astronomer George Bond recorded the outer extensions of diffuse objects by placing&nbsp;the object outside the field of view and then letting it drift back in until he&nbsp;detected a change in the brightness of the sky background. I tried a modified version of this technique with M51. Using 130X, I moved the telescope toward M51 from the west and found a clear gap between M51 and&nbsp;its companion, until I reached the eastern boundaries of the two, where I&nbsp;encountered a slight increase in brightness that ended the canal. I&nbsp;repeated this sweep several times. Each time, soon after my mental canoe&nbsp;went sailing down that dark canal it collided with this phantom bridge.&nbsp;Then, I reversed the sweep, moving from east to west toward the two&nbsp;galaxies. There was no &quot;entrance&quot; to the canal; I was stopped immediately&nbsp;by the bridge. Tty this sweeping technique yourself to discover your own&nbsp;truth about the visibility of the phantom bridge.</p>
<p class="font49">M5Ts spiral shape may be the result of tidal interactions with NGC 5195.

It was while&nbsp;observing the comet that&nbsp;appeared in that year that M.&nbsp;Messier saw this cluster,&nbsp;which was close to the comet&nbsp;on 7 September 1774. It is&nbsp;below the star d （Flamsteed 4]&nbsp;in Cassiopeia. Star d was used&nbsp;to determine the positions of&nbsp;the star cluster and the comet.</span></p>

<p class="font49">M52 is one of my favorite open clusters for binoculars - not because it trumpets starlight, but because it doesn't. The 7th-magnitude cluster is&nbsp;merely a large uniform glow; subconsciously, I must find that simplicity&nbsp;soothing. Although I tried very hard, I could not convince myself of&nbsp;seeing it with the unaided eye. The cluster lies about south of 4&nbsp;Cassiopeiae, a reddish 5th-magnitude star about 6° northwest of Beta<span class="font30">（</span><span class="font49">P</span><span class="font30">）</span><span class="font49">&nbsp;Cassiopeiae.</span></p>

<p class="font49">cluster. About 20 million years young, it measures 24 light years in diameter and contains nearly 200 members brighter than 15th magnitude. The cluster's computed central density is 56 stars per cubic parsec; in Messiefs&nbsp;catalogue, only Mil and M67 are denser open clusters.</p>
<p class="font49">Ybu will be immediately struck by the forceful presence of an 8th-magnitude topaz field star on the cluster's southwestern edge. This star all but leaps out at you, as if trying to steal the show. It is an imposter,&nbsp;however, not an actual member of the cluster. Interestingly, when I first&nbsp;looked at the star, and then at the cluster, which has an overall bluish hue,&nbsp;the topaz color of the star seemed even more pronounced. Wiebb and&nbsp;Smyth saw this star as orange, and Mallas recorded it as a conspicuous&nbsp;reddish star. Webb almost sounds sarcastic in his description of M52:&nbsp;&quot;Irregular, with orange star, as is frequently the case,&quot; but he is merely&nbsp;noting that usually the most outstanding member of an open cluster&nbsp;shines with a ruddy hue.</p>
<p class="font49">With a quick glance at low power, M52 looks like a tight ball of tiny crystal chips reflecting blue light. A longer view will reveal a little isolated&nbsp;patch of starlight just to the northwest of a heart-shaped central body; a&nbsp;much larger patch lies to the southeast. With 72 x, the shape of the&nbsp;cluster's stars looks rather arachnoid, like a scorpion. Thin wisps of faint&nbsp;stars jut from the body like tiny legs, and patches of starlight form the&nbsp;claws. The scorpion's swooping tail curves to the north, where it joins the&nbsp;topaz scar. Iwo stinger stars follow to the east.</p>
<p class="font49">The main, heart-shaped body of starlight contains many uniformly bright stars caging a haze of fainter members, which requires peripheral&nbsp;vision to resolve. When you don't stare directly at this cage, do you see the&nbsp;thin, dark rift running along the southeastern side of the scorpion's body?</p>
<p class="font49">While in the vicinity, try to glimpse the elusive Bubble Nebula (NGC 7635). Only 35'southwest of M52, this very dim ring of gas, whose brightest section surrounds an 8.5-magnitude star, is only weakly visible from&nbsp;dark skies. Although it resembles a planetary nebula, the Bubble is a fairly&nbsp;ordinary HII region, a vast cloud of ionized hydrogen.</p><img src="Deep-sky companions the Messier objects by Stephen James OMeara (z-lib_files/Deep-sky companions the Messier objects by Stephen James OMeara (z-lib-147.jpg" style="width:51pt;height:49pt;"/><div>

<p class="font49">William Herschel described M53 as one of the most beautiful sights in the heavens. Still, this whopping 200-light-year-wide sphere of stars is an&nbsp;unsung hero among globulars for small telescopes. Perhaps that is&nbsp;because it sits on the fringe of the Coma-Virgo Cluster of galaxies, like a&nbsp;flower outside a forest of redwoods. But it is a bold glow, and even binoculars will reveal its 7.5-magnitude, 13'disk only about 1° northeast of the&nbsp;binary Alpha (a) Comae Berenices.</p>
<p class="font49">And what a haunting Held M53 is in. Wlienever I peer at the globular, my averted gaze continually picks up a multitude of dim spectral shapes,&nbsp;which seem to flitter across the low-power field. While most are close&nbsp;doubles, one pale ashen sheen belongs to the loose globular NGC 5053,&nbsp;which looms 1° southeast of M53 like the departed soul of its more brilliant neighbor.</p>
<p class="font49">With a glance at low power, M53 appears as a tight, unresolved ball of light with a faint outer halo. Use averted vision, however, and the inner&nbsp;halo, which surrounds a crisp starlike nucleus with a tangerine hue,&nbsp;begins to look boxy. At 72 x, the inner region reveals its beauty: look for a&nbsp;pale gemstone inside a tiny jeweled chest, which is encased inside a larger&nbsp;jeweled chest; the chests are aligned east-west. High power shatters the&nbsp;jewel, whose opalescent fragments seem to sparkle through a thinning&nbsp;cloud of dust. Thus, no longer does the core look so tight, though I still see&nbsp;a tiny &quot;nucleus&quot; flanked by a wall of stars to the south. Use keen averted&nbsp;vision and relax your gaze. Do you see the dark rift abutting the south wall&nbsp;(refer to the drawing)?</p>
<p class="font49">Now return to 72 x. The cluster appears twisted, as if someone tried to wring out the stars in the northern half. This strange sight is created by&nbsp;four claws of stars ripping through the outer hood to the north and west;&nbsp;the three northern extensions appear to be topped by a faint arc of&nbsp;starlight emanating from the westernmost finger. Meanwhile, the southern half of the cluster looks triangular, with the apex of the triangle point-ing due west. I wonder if this is what Luginbuhl and Skiff were referring to&nbsp;when they wrote that **in poor seeing the core of the cluster looks roughly&nbsp;triangular.&quot;</p>
<p class="font49">Although M53 can easily be seen with binoculars, I could not positively identify it with the naked eye. I do believe someone with eyes younger than mine could. The problem is separating it from 4th-magni-tude Alpha Comae Berenices.</p><div><img src="Deep-sky companions the Messier objects by Stephen James OMeara (z-lib_files/Deep-sky companions the Messier objects by Stephen James OMeara (z-lib-148.jpg" style="width:171pt;height:148pt;"/></div><br clear="all"><div>

The&nbsp;center is bright, and it does&nbsp;not contain any stars: seen&nbsp;with an achromatic three and&nbsp;a half-foot refractor. Its&nbsp;position was determined&nbsp;relative to third-magnitude g&nbsp;Sagittarii.</span></p></div><br clear="all">
<p class="font49">In 1994 astronomers discovered a large, faint dwarf galaxy in Sagittarius that was superposed on the globular cluster M54. Actually, it appears that&nbsp;M54 belongs to the Sagittarius dwarf, which our Milky Way Galaxy is now&nbsp;cannibalizing. Although M54 probably formed at the same time as the&nbsp;dwarf galaxy, only now to be accreted into the Milky Way, some&nbsp;astronomers now believe that globulars are the <span class="font49" style="font-style:italic;">products</span><span class="font49"> of galactic cannibalization. When two galaxies collide or merge, the interaction can either&nbsp;trigger star formation or leave remnant clumps of accreted galactic&nbsp;matter, which turn into globular clusters. Try imagining this the next time&nbsp;you peer at seemingly insignificant M54!</span></p>
<p class="font49">Beaming from a distance of 70,000 light years, M54 is the farthest of all the Messier globulars. Yet, it is no problem for 7x35 binoculars,&nbsp;appearing as a bright starlikc object 1%° west-southwest of Zeta (J)&nbsp;Sagittarii, at the base of the teapot. But being so distant, the duster does&nbsp;not easily reveal its secrets to telescopic viewers. In the Genesis at 23 x, the&nbsp;globular is a softly glowing fuzzy star, sort of what Omega Centauri looks&nbsp;like to the naked eye. (Shapley considered M54 perfectly round.) At 72 x,&nbsp;the 244-light-year-wide globular remains largely unresolved, though&nbsp;some outliers in the halo pop into and out of view-a perception shared by&nbsp;Skiff using a 10-inch telescope. This view confirms John Herschel's&nbsp;impression that the brightest stars in the cluster hover around 14th magnitude, though photometry of the cluster shows the brightest members&nbsp;are actually about 15th magnitude. Regardless, M54 displays a bright,&nbsp;starlike core surrounded by a tight yellowish inner halo that gradually diffuses outward. With persistent averted vision, the cluster looks more like a</p><div><img src="Deep-sky companions the Messier objects by Stephen James OMeara (z-lib_files/Deep-sky companions the Messier objects by Stephen James OMeara (z-lib-151.jpg" style="width:170pt;height:133pt;"/></div><br clear="all"><div>

<p class="font49">The view changes once again at 130 x. Now M54 begins to look like a face-on spiral galaxy just beginning to show resolution. Namely, two arms&nbsp;of very faint stars in the cluster's northern envelope appear to swirl counterclockwise around the nucleus. Clear gaps separate these features from&nbsp;one another and from the core. I did note an orange star superposed on&nbsp;one of these arms. Can you determine which one?</p><div>

<p class="font49">One of the most southerly globulars observed by Messier, M55 was included in a study of globular cluster motion, which revealed that these&nbsp;stellar agglomerations are moving at high speeds (greater than 100 miles&nbsp;per second) in elliptical orbits through the distant halo of our galaxy - like&nbsp;long-period comets in orbit around our sun. At a distance of only 17,000&nbsp;light years, however, M55 is relatively nearby (consider that M54 is 70,000&nbsp;light years distant). ¥au can see it with the naked eye on the outskirts of the&nbsp;Milky Way band about 8° east-southeast of Zeta ([) Sagittarii. In 7x35&nbsp;binoculars M55 looks like a hairy star. With the 4-inch at 23 x, the cluster&nbsp;starts to splinter across its large and loose surface - a refreshing sight after&nbsp;looking at the smaller, more difficult globulars M54, M69, and M70&nbsp;nearby. In fact, M55s disk looks huge when compared to the disks of those&nbsp;globulars, even at high power.</p>
<p class="font49">One night I had the pleasure of watching an earth-orbiting satellite sail across M55's misty bay of light. Such transits are becoming increasingly common to deep-sky observers. Such an event puts the scale of the&nbsp;universe, or our little corner of it anyway, in perspective. Here was a manmade craft about the size of a Volkswagen van and a few hundred miles&nbsp;away drifting in front of a cluster of stars a mind-boggling 93 light years&nbsp;wide and 17,000 light years distant. In my mind's eye the cluster swelled to&nbsp;magnificent proportions, as the moon does when it looms on the horizon.</p>
<p class="font49">At 72 x a multitude of bright suns are scattered across a homogeneous background of fainter stars. Many of the cluster's members are nicely resolved into stellar arcs, somewhat reminiscent of the parallel&nbsp;streams in M25. Patterns visible in the background haze are out of sync&nbsp;with those formed by the brighter suns. This, combined with the way&nbsp;several dark lanes infiltrate the cluster from all sides, leads to a most</p>
<p class="font49">impressive, albeit complicated, view. Ripples of stars and dark waves seem to be flowing into the cluster from the southeast, forming a cove, or&nbsp;what Luginbuhl and Skiff referred to as a<sup>H</sup> large bite&quot; out of the cluster's&nbsp;outer halo. Another such bite appears to have been taken out of the northwestern part of the outer halo.</p><div><img src="Deep-sky companions the Messier objects by Stephen James OMeara (z-lib_files/Deep-sky companions the Messier objects by Stephen James OMeara (z-lib-153.jpg" style="width:171pt;height:191pt;"/></div><br clear="all"><div><img src="Deep-sky companions the Messier objects by Stephen James OMeara (z-lib_files/Deep-sky companions the Messier objects by Stephen James OMeara (z-lib-154.jpg" style="width:171pt;height:132pt;"/></div><br clear="all">
<p class="font49">The central, southern curve of stars becomes very pronounced at 130 x, but I still prefer the moderate power for an overall view. That's when&nbsp;a bright star in a dark hole at the center of the cluster shows up the best. A&nbsp;strong dark bar extends equidistant southwest and northeast of that&nbsp;central star and dark hole. Also, dark forks branch off from the southwest&nbsp;axis, forming the negative image of a &quot;peace&quot; symbol. One doesn't expect&nbsp;to find a hole in the center of a compressed globular. Indeed, this is an illusion. As Burnham explains, <sup>H</sup>The unusual 'openness* of this cluster... is&nbsp;due to the fact that only a relatively small percent of the members exceed a&nbsp;brightness of 13th-14th magnitude, and the duster does not begin to 'fill&nbsp;in* until one reaches about 17th magnitude where a vast swarm of stars&nbsp;quite suddenly appears?*</p><div><img src="Deep-sky companions the Messier objects by Stephen James OMeara (z-lib_files/Deep-sky companions the Messier objects by Stephen James OMeara (z-lib-155.jpg" style="width:243pt;height:309pt;"/></div><br clear="all">

<p class="font49">When a star with a mass similar to that of our sun nears the end of its life, it blows off a shell of gas that, from our perspective, appears like a ring centered around the dying star. M57, the Ring Nebula, represents the remains&nbsp;of one such disgorging episode about 20,000 years ago. The first planetary&nbsp;nebula discovered, it has worked its way ever since into the hearts of virtually all telescopic observers. And rightly so, because no other planetary&nbsp;appears so distinctive in small apertures.</p>
<p class="font49">It is a challenging binocular object, well placed in the northern sky about 6%° southeast of brilliant Vega (Alpha la] Lyrae), and nearly halfway&nbsp;between the eclipsing binary star Beta (0) Lyrae (whose brightness fluctuates between magnitude 3.3 and 4.3 every 12.9 days) and 3rd-magnitude&nbsp;Gamma (7) Lyrae. Telescopically, M57*s tiny 9th-magnitude annulus of&nbsp;gray smoke floats against a rich Milky Way field crisscrossed with dark&nbsp;streamers, some of which appear to be as gray and smoky as the Ring&nbsp;Nebula itself.</p>
<p class="font49">The &quot;ring&quot; is actually a torus (doughnut-shaped) viewed looking down the hole. This is unlike the planetary M27, which is seen side on. The&nbsp;0.4-light-year-wide gaseous wreath ofM57 was likely blown off the whitedwarf central star some 20,000 years ago and is still expanding at a rate of&nbsp;about 16.5 miles per second, or about 1&quot; per centuiy</p><div>

<p><span class="font48" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">messier: I Observed 31 January 1779] Patch of light&nbsp;between the stars yand </span><span class="font48" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">p&nbsp;</span><span class="font48" style="font-weight:bold;">Lyrae, discovered while&nbsp;observing the comet of 1779,&nbsp;which passed very close. It&nbsp;seemed that this patch of&nbsp;light, which has rounded&nbsp;borders, must be composed of&nbsp;very faint stars. It has not,&nbsp;however, been possible to see&nbsp;them, even with the best&nbsp;telescopes, but the suspicion&nbsp;remains that there are some.&nbsp;M. Messier plotted this patch&nbsp;of light on the chart for the&nbsp;comet of 1779. M. Darquier, at&nbsp;Toulouse, discovered this&nbsp;nebula when observing the&nbsp;same comet, and he reported&nbsp;“Nebula between y and </span><span class="font48" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">0&nbsp;</span><span class="font48" style="font-weight:bold;">Lyrae, it is extremely faint, but&nbsp;perfectly outlined.

<p class="font49">One night when I viewed M57 nearly overhead at 72 x, I found the sight almost shocking. Not only was the &quot;hole&quot; clearly visible but the&nbsp;entire ring appeared to scintillate with stellar jewels - foreground stars&nbsp;superposed on the gaseous loop. As my eye raced to see one star in the&nbsp;nebula, my averted vision captured another. As soon as that one was&nbsp;spied, my averted vision jumped to the next one. In this way the stars&nbsp;seemed to <span class="font49" style="font-style:italic;">revolve</span><span class="font49"> around the ring like the flashing of light bulbs around a&nbsp;Las Vegas billboard. Some nineteenth-century observers alluded to seeing&nbsp;this effect. For example, astronomer Angelo Secchi believed he resolved&nbsp;the ring into minute stars ''glittering like stardust,&quot; and Webb saw M57*s&nbsp;light as &quot;unsteady... probably an illusion.&quot;</span></p>
<p class="font49">The brightest star in the gaseous ring shines at 13th magnitude and is located just 1 'east of center, 20<sup>M</sup> beyond the extreme outer rim. A 14th-magnitude star lies just inside the Ring's southwest rim and is commonly&nbsp;mistaken for the central star. In most star catalogues the blue-dwarf&nbsp;central star is listed as 15th magnitude, but its brightness is the subject of&nbsp;considerable debate. About 80 years of photometric data reported in the&nbsp;<span class="font49" style="font-style:italic;">Catalogue of the Central Stars of True and Possible Planetary Nebulae&nbsp;</span><span class="font49">(Acker and Gliezas, Observatory of Strasbourg, 1982) show the central star&nbsp;varying from magnitude 13 to magnitude 15. Skiff notes that several&nbsp;recent photoelectric measurements give values of magnitude 15.0 to 15.2.&nbsp;Many veteran skywatchers have estimated it to be as bright as 14th magnitude (putting it within range of a good 4-inch telescope under a dark sky).&nbsp;Yet Burnham notes that the star was fainter than 16th magnitude when he&nbsp;looked at it in 1959 through the 40-inch reflector at Lowell Observatory.&nbsp;Although the star appears to be variable, this may only partly explain the&nbsp;disparate magnitude estimates. One summer evening in 1988, my wife.&nbsp;Donna, and I were visiting conwt discoverer Michael Rudenko at the 18-inch refractor at Amherst College in Massachusetts. Some observers had&nbsp;turned the telescope to the Ring Nebula and were complaining that they&nbsp;could not see the central star. When I looked through the eyepiece, I&nbsp;noticed that the apparent size of the Ring was so small that the &quot;hole&quot;&nbsp;actually appeared bright, diminishing the contrast between the star and&nbsp;its background. I removed that eyepiece and replaced it wi</span><span class="font28">【</span><span class="font49">h another one&nbsp;that provided about 1,000 x magnification. And - voilci! - the central star&nbsp;burst into view, suggesting that the apparent brightness of the star </span><span class="font49" style="font-style:italic;">is&nbsp;</span><span class="font49">affected by the surrounding nebulosity.</span></p><div><img src="Deep-sky companions the Messier objects by Stephen James OMeara (z-lib_files/Deep-sky companions the Messier objects by Stephen James OMeara (z-lib-159.jpg" style="width:171pt;height:135pt;"/></div><br clear="all"><div><img src="Deep-sky companions the Messier objects by Stephen James OMeara (z-lib_files/Deep-sky companions the Messier objects by Stephen James OMeara (z-lib-160.jpg" style="width:170pt;height:132pt;"/></div><br clear="all">
<p class="font49">i also looked at the Ring through two 40-inch reflectors, one atop Pic du Midi in the Prench Pyrenees, the other at Lick Observatory on Mount&nbsp;Hamilton, California. At Pic du Midi, William Sheehan and 1 centered M57&nbsp;in the finder scope<span class="font30">・</span><span class="font49"> but were then surprised that we could not see it in the&nbsp;main telescope; all we saw was a pair of stars. It turned out that at 1,200 x&nbsp;lhe gaseous ring was outside our tiny field of view; we were seeing only the&nbsp;central star and its similarly bright neighbor to the northwest, which&nbsp;allowed us to conclude that the central star shines at around magnitude&nbsp;14.5. Interestingly, though I saw the central star through the 40-inch&nbsp;reflector at Lick Observatory, I did so only with great difficulty - the view&nbsp;was at low power, and I was not in a position to change the eyepiece. Once&nbsp;again, rhe contrast between the star and its background was diminished.&nbsp;Now, consider that on 2 September 1981, Archinal made a detailed&nbsp;drawing of M57 based on his observations with Lowell Observaiory's 72</span><span class="font30">・</span><span class="font49">&nbsp;inch reflector on Anderson Mesa in Arizona, which shows that the central&nbsp;stars neighbor was noticeably fainter than the central star (or the central&nbsp;star was noticeably brighter than the neighboring star), perhaps by 1 to 2&nbsp;magnitudes! He concludes that the central star is between 15th and 16th&nbsp;magnitude. &quot;When I've had problems making it out/* he reports. “I can tell&nbsp;that its usually due to poor seeing or poor-quality large-aperture telescopes or eyepieces.**</span></p>
<p class="font49">Houston argued that the ability to see the central star is also enhanced by ones color sensitivity: those with blue-sensitive eyes are&nbsp;more apt to see it. He confirmed this for hitnself after having a cataract&nbsp;operation, where his yellowed lens was replaced with a fresh transparent&nbsp;one, thus allowing more ultraviolet radiation into the eye. I have seen the&nbsp;central star with the 9- and 15-inch refractors at Harvard College&nbsp;Observatory at high magnifications. And I'm convinced a skilled observer&nbsp;could see it in even smaller telescopes <span class="font28">一 </span><span class="font49">ones that can tolerate high mag-nificalions well. A steady atmosphere is also required.</span></p>
<p class="font49">But high power really is necessary because, as John Herschel noticed, the interior of the ring is &quot;filled with a feeble but very evident&nbsp;light.&quot; And Rosse, through his great reflector, saw striations. The trick to&nbsp;perceiving Herschel's feeble light with a small aperture is to use 23 x and&nbsp;72 x and compare the intensity of the interior of the ring with that of the&nbsp;sky just outside the ring. Some observers stop &quot;looking&quot; after they see the&nbsp;Ring's dark hole, missing the opportunity to see the weak interior glow.</p>
<p class="font49">Finally, I always like to end an observing session by returning to low power and &quot;relaxing.&quot; When I do this with M57,1 see the ring as an inflated&nbsp;inner tube afloat in a semicircular black pond. Now concentrate on the&nbsp;dark &quot;water.<sup>0</sup> Do you see glints of moonlight reflecting off the wave crests?</p><div><img src="Deep-sky companions the Messier objects by Stephen James OMeara (z-lib_files/Deep-sky companions the Messier objects by Stephen James OMeara (z-lib-161.jpg" style="width:246pt;height:354pt;"/></div><br clear="all">

<p class="font49">is also north of a most intriguing double galaxy, NGC 4567 and NGC 4568, also known as the Siamese <sup>r</sup>Iwins. At 23x, M58 displays only a starlike&nbsp;nucleus surrounded by a uniform halo that gradually fades into the background. But 72 x immediately brings out a mottled halo and a patchy&nbsp;inner glow, and 130 x starts to reveal some of the galaxy's subtle structure.</p>
<p class="font49">When looking at galaxies with high- power, I usually alternate between using hyperventilation (see page 23) and relaxation techniques&nbsp;to visually chisel out detail. For M58 the first features to materialize out of&nbsp;the galactic haze are knots on the east and west ends of the nuclear region,&nbsp;followed by the dim extensions that outline the galaxy's gently curving&nbsp;arms. Only the northeastern part of the bar connecting the outer knots to&nbsp;the nucleus is definitely visible in the 4-inch; the bar to the southwest was&nbsp;merely a suggestion, probably because our eyes like to create patterns.&nbsp;Jones, however, reported clearly detecting the bar from England in an 8-inch telescope!</p>
<p class="font49">Concentrate on the innermost nuclear region. Here I do see a bar connected to faint arcs. The details in this inner region wonderfully replicate those in the outer halo, only they're just slightly skewed.</p><div><img src="Deep-sky companions the Messier objects by Stephen James OMeara (z-lib_files/Deep-sky companions the Messier objects by Stephen James OMeara (z-lib-165.jpg" style="width:246pt;height:141pt;"/></div><br clear="all">
<p class="font49">The two elliptical galaxies M59 and M60 fit neatly in the same field of view with M58 in 7X35 binoculars. M60 is clearly the brightest of this trio in&nbsp;Virgo. But this revelation caused me alarm, because Jones had recorded&nbsp;M60 almost a full magnitude <span class="font49" style="font-style:italic;">fainter</span><span class="font49"> than M58 (8.8 and 9.6, respectively),&nbsp;and Mallas had found the two to be of similar magnitude (9th).&nbsp;Fortunately, Skiff came to my rescue, noting that the </span><span class="font49" style="font-style:italic;">Second Reference&nbsp;Catalog of Bright Galaxies</span><span class="font49"> (Gerard deVaucouleurs and A. de Wucouleurs,&nbsp;University oflexas Press, 1976) lists M60 as being nearly a full magnitude&nbsp;brighter than M58, which agrees with my estimate.</span></p>
<p class="font49">1 cannot help but think of an elliptical galaxy as little more than a uniformly bright and structureless glow. But my impression is one created&nbsp;largely by photographic images. So I am always surprised (and somewhat&nbsp;incredulous) whenever I look at an elliptical galaxy through a telescope&nbsp;and actually see detail. These statements probably say a lot about the&nbsp;power of photography to alter our visual perception.</p>
<p class="font49">For example, I was surprised to see that M59 contains a sharp star-like nucleus, because you hardly ever see one in a long-exposure photo-graph. (1 wasn't aware that John Herschel had noted M59 was &quot;very suddenly much brighter in the middle,&quot; and that Jones had also detected&nbsp;the starlike core.) M59 also looks monied, though I could not tell whether&nbsp;(his is because of faint stars superposed on it. or from actual dust lanes&nbsp;and patches, or from physiological effects. The brightness across the disk&nbsp;is definitely asymmetrical, with the northwest quadrant decidedly&nbsp;brighter than the southeast. Most puzzling is what appears to be a faint,&nbsp;needlelike bar running through <span class="font28">让</span><span class="font49">s major axis - a feature I have seen associated with other ellipticals. It is probably just an illusion, though. Is there&nbsp;any way to verify the existence of such a perplexing sight?</span></p><div>

<p class="font49">Among the largest ellipticals, M60 measures 118,000 light years across and is some 200 times more massive than the elliptical galaxy M32,&nbsp;the more condensed companion of the Andromeda Galaxy. By comparison, M59 is 32,000 light years smaller than M60. Like M59, M60 also has a&nbsp;starlike nucleus. Admittedly, when 1 first saw M60's crisp central star, then&nbsp;thought of its fuzzy photographic image, and then noticed that the galaxy&nbsp;was brighter than 9.6-magnitude M5&amp; how could I not suspect a supernova? But, that isn't the case. As Luginbuhl and Skiff note, 8.8-magnitude&nbsp;M60 is an evenly fading circular glow with a faint central pip. M60 has a&nbsp;tiny companion, NGC 4647,2'.5 to the northwest, whose seemingly transparent glow is a pleasing sight. This galaxy duet reminds me of Alcor and&nbsp;Mizar, the famous naked-eye optical double star in the handle of the Big</p>
<p class="font49">□ipper. Unlike M60, NGC 4647 is a face-on spiral comprising 10 billion suns. Webb missed it with a 3.7-inch telescope, which, I am certain, says&nbsp;more about the hazy England skies than about the observer himself.</p>
<p class="font49">But consider the following experience. Midway between M59 and M60, and to the south, is the 12th-magnitude elliptical galaxy NGC 4638.1&nbsp;find that by staring directly at NGC 4638 at 130x, M60's tiny companion&nbsp;burns into view in my peripheral vision! But, when Ilook directly at M60,&nbsp;the companion disappears. Thus I refer to NGC 4647 as the &quot;disappearing&nbsp;galaxy.&quot; With averted vision NGC 4647 really swells and displays definite&nbsp;inner and outer sections. It also looks gray.</p>
<p class="font49">Photometric data show the colors ofM59 and M60 to be almost identical, but to me M59 looks bluer than M60, which has a yellower tint. In fact, if you use high power and relax, M60 appears to have an intense&nbsp;yellow core that seems to be surrounded by countless glistening beads&nbsp;forming a diamond-shaped structure around it.</p><div>

<p class="font49">Here we have one of the most pleasing open-faced spirals in the Messier catalogue for small telescope users. This may be due to its small apparent&nbsp;size <span class="font28">一 </span><span class="font49">6'.5 x 5'.8 - which condenses the galaxy's light, making the features&nbsp;more apparent. With a true diameter of about 100,000 light years, though,&nbsp;M61 is one of the larger galaxies in the Virgo Cloud. A magnificently&nbsp;detailed system with crooked arms, it is easily located 5<sup>0</sup> north and slightly&nbsp;east of Eta On) Virginis, halfway between the 6th-magnitude stars 16 and&nbsp;17 Virginis. Although I could detect its feeble 10th-magnitude light with&nbsp;7x35 binoculars, it is essentially at the binocular limit, and I imagine&nbsp;would be difficult to glimpse in skies that were not very clear and dark.</span></p>
<p class="font49">The <span class="font49" style="font-style:italic;">NGC</span><span class="font49"> description uncharacteristically misled me into thinking M61 would appear brighter and larger than it really is. At 23 x the galaxy is&nbsp;so small and faint that I almost swept over it. perhaps because it is tucked&nbsp;away in the crook of a nice wishbone asterism of 9th-magnitude stars.&nbsp;Take the time to concentrate on M61*s light, which with averted vision&nbsp;appears to gradually dilate into an appreciable disk. Don't be surprised if&nbsp;your eye also begins to notice other ghostly glows hiding among a forest of&nbsp;similarly bright stars populating the region. These are the dim and distant&nbsp;shapes of at least a dozen nearby NGC galaxies!</span></p>
<p class="font49">M61 itself reveals a brightening at the center that pops into view only with averted vision. This nucleus is centered in a fairly condensed halo of&nbsp;light that is wrapped in an even fainter shell. The fading into view (or out&nbsp;of view, depending on how you stare at it) of this faint outer envelope is the&nbsp;reason the galaxy appears to swell (and shrink), which is why I refer to M61&nbsp;as the Swelling Spiral.</p><div><img src="Deep-sky companions the Messier objects by Stephen James OMeara (z-lib_files/Deep-sky companions the Messier objects by Stephen James OMeara (z-lib-167.jpg" style="width:136pt;height:163pt;"/></div><br clear="all">

<p class="font49">Moderate power does not add much to the view, though it does start to reveal star-forming regions, which appear as knots in the outer halo.&nbsp;But because this galaxy is so tight, high power is required to resolve it into&nbsp;its separate parts. And what a very interesting view it is at 130x1 A starlike&nbsp;nucleus is surrounded by a mottled, diamond-shaped inner core. With&nbsp;averted vision the northernmost knot shows an extension that trails off&nbsp;irregularly to the east in a wavelike fashion, like a gracefully thin wake of&nbsp;smoke. Closer to the nucleus and to the south is another star -studded&nbsp;region that trickles off in lumps to the west before it curves sharply to the&nbsp;north. A faint but definite arm can be glimpsed to the east, and it boxes in&nbsp;the nuclear region. Overall, at high power, the galaxy looks like a square&nbsp;with slightly rounded edges. Through his 4-inch refractor, Mallas also&nbsp;observed three luminous patches outside the nucleus, which match the&nbsp;positions ofM61 *s spiral arms seen in photographs.</p>

<p class="font49">Odd and mystifying are the words that seem to best describe M62 in Ophiuchus. A 6.7-magnitude globular 63 light years wide, it is singled out&nbsp;in the literature mostly for its strong asymmetry. John Herschel, Jones,&nbsp;and Shapley all noted its curious shape, as now I do. M62 is the closest&nbsp;Messier globular to the nucleus of the Milky Way Galaxy, so the strong&nbsp;gravitational tug on the globular might account for its peculiar visage.&nbsp;Specifically, the western half of the cluster is dramatically brighter than&nbsp;the eastern half. Although Mallas was aware of M62's asymmetry, he could&nbsp;not convince himself of seeing it. I don*t understand why; Even at 72 x, the&nbsp;western half stands out boldly against the stars of the Milky Way, while the&nbsp;cluster's weaker, eastern stars quickly fade as you move away from center.&nbsp;At the eastern edge, several strings of stars dangle like loose threads in a&nbsp;tattered cloth. Looking at it differently, that shredded eastern section&nbsp;makes M62 appear like a still photograph of a balloon just beginning to&nbsp;burst, with the &quot;air&quot; rushing out to the east-southeast.</p>
<p class="font49">But I find M62 mystifying for reasons other than its asymmetry, which I have seen in other globulars (to a lesser degree), such as M56 in</p><div><img src="Deep-sky companions the Messier objects by Stephen James OMeara (z-lib_files/Deep-sky companions the Messier objects by Stephen James OMeara (z-lib-169.jpg" style="width:170pt;height:132pt;"/>

<p class="font49">Lyra. What fascinates me is that the core of M62 appears to flicker, like a dying flame. The effect is hypnotic. One night, while watching that flame&nbsp;dance at 72 x, I quickly broke the spell and changed to an eyepiece yielding 130 x. Still, my gaze was magically drawn toward the center! The core&nbsp;retained its ruddy cast and continued to pulsate. Seeking an explanation&nbsp;for this intriguing effect, I soon figured out that it was not real - the core&nbsp;isn't actually pulsating in brightness <span class="font28">一 </span><span class="font49">but an optical illusion.</span></p>
<p class="font49">The western section of the tight inner core has three distinct waves of starlight that seem to ripple out from the ruddy nucleus (see the&nbsp;drawing). Given the wealth of detail in such a small area, my eye cannot&nbsp;help but leap outward from wave crest to wave crest and then return to the&nbsp;nucleus, where the process repeats. As that is happening with my eyes, my&nbsp;mind is trying to fathom another illusion: faint rings of starlight appear to&nbsp;be rippling out from the core and <span class="font49" style="font-style:italic;">toward</span><span class="font49"> the viewer! These changing&nbsp;optical moire effects set the cluster's core into seeming animation.</span></p>
<p class="font49">Equally intriguing is that as the nucleus &quot;flickers,&quot; its color changes like that of a flame in a breeze; one moment it is smoky yellow, the next it's&nbsp;dusky red. This, I believe, results from the eye shifting rapidly back and&nbsp;forth between the reddish center and the yellowish inner halo. The outer&nbsp;envelope also wavers with a pale bluish light. These effects do not appear&nbsp;to be atmospheric (the cluster is some 40° high from my observing site),&nbsp;but physiological (differential refraction can also cause color changes). I&nbsp;saw a similar visual effect one day when staring at a neighbors needlepoint of a cat.</p>

<p class="font49">In photographs M63 looks like a spiral galaxy that has lost control of <span class="font28">让</span><span class="font49">s gravity, and we are catching a rare sight of its arms being tossed into space.&nbsp;This spiral, which shines with the light of 10 billion suns, is a prime&nbsp;example of a type of galaxy that displays a lack of cohesion between its&nbsp;inner and outer arms. The inner region of M63s 86,000-light-year-wide&nbsp;disk is ringed by strong spiral structure, while the plentiful outer arms&nbsp;appear loose, patchy, and haphazard. Not surprisingly, M63 is nicknamed&nbsp;the Sunflower Galaxy because of its resemblance to that towering plant&nbsp;whose dense, seedy head is ringed by an abundance ofbright, overlapping&nbsp;petals.</span></p>
<p class="font49">To find this special-case Messier galaxy, use low power and sweep about 2° north of 20 Canum Venaticorum, a 4.7-magnitude star about 5<span class="font28">肾&nbsp;</span><span class="font49">northeast of Alpha<sup>1</sup>-<sup>2</sup> (a<sup>1</sup>-<sup>2</sup>) Canum Venaticorum, a fine double composed&nbsp;of a blue 2.9-magnitude primary and a white 5.5-magnitude secondary&nbsp;separated by 19&quot;.

<p class="font49">Through a telescope at 23x, its soft glow reveals hints of a mottled structure in the pale outer disk, while (he core is tack sharp. The challenge&nbsp;is to use moderate and high power to make sense of the arms. This will&nbsp;probably require several nights at the telescope making drawings. The&nbsp;problem I encountered when starting my drawings was that I could not&nbsp;instantly determine which way (he spiral arms wind around the core -clockwise or counterclockwise - all the details are so delicate. In fact, M63</p><img src="Deep-sky companions the Messier objects by Stephen James OMeara (z-lib_files/Deep-sky companions the Messier objects by Stephen James OMeara (z-lib-171.jpg" style="width:243pt;height:261pt;"/>
<p class="font49">is one of the most finely detailed galaxies in the Messier catalogue in small telescopes. You will need patience. I start by focusing in on the innermost&nbsp;glow, where the spiral pattern is more strongly suggested. It almost helps&nbsp;to blur your vision or defocus the image in the telescope ever so slightly, so&nbsp;that the patches blend into arms. Archinal notes that this resolution&nbsp;problem is similar<span class="font30">(</span><span class="font49">o that observed with M51, where early observers&nbsp;noticed only a </span><span class="font49" style="font-style:italic;">ring,</span><span class="font49"> not spiral arms.</span></p>

Therefore, I recorded it indirectly. The feature certainly is not visually obvious in small telescopes, so don't let the&nbsp;photograph fool you. Use high power to search for the black eye, because&nbsp;the apparent size of the galaxy (10' x 5'.4), and especially its inner core, is&nbsp;small.

The surface brightness of M65 and M66 is roughly the same, 12.4&nbsp;and 12.5, respeciively; this means that each arc minute of the galaxy&nbsp;shines roughly with the brightness of a 12.5-magnitude star. So the difference in surface brightness between M65 and M66, a mere 0.1 magnitude&nbsp;per square arc minute, is not sufficient to account for the brightness dis-crepancyi Without question, in photographs the tightly wound mass of&nbsp;M66, with its burning core and clumps of star-forming regions, looks&nbsp;brighter than the more normal-looking spiral M65. But photographic&nbsp;images do not reflect what is seen visually. I also made my magnitude estimate with 7 x 35 binoculars, so as not to be fooled by the telescopic&nbsp;appearances.</p>
<p class="font49">An optical phenomenon can make M65 appear larger than it really is</p><div><img src="Deep-sky companions the Messier objects by Stephen James OMeara (z-lib_files/Deep-sky companions the Messier objects by Stephen James OMeara (z-lib-174.jpg" style="width:61pt;height:91pt;"/></div><br clear="all"><div>

But when 1 concentrate on the more brightly illuminated area,&nbsp;the galaxy appears quite stubby. This illusion of infinite length is caused&nbsp;by (he dust lane that sharpens the galaxy's eastern limb, which the eye&nbsp;likes to extend.</span></p>
<p class="font49">M65 is a joy to see but an awfully difficult galaxy to observe. The details within its bright, nearly edge-on disk vary only slightly from the&nbsp;background brightness, so they're hard to pick out from the &quot;noise.&quot; But&nbsp;they can be recorded with accuracy once you familiarize yourself with the&nbsp;galaxy after a few observing sessions. Just focus on a different part of the&nbsp;galaxy each night. Use 72 x to survey the diamond-shaped nuclear region,&nbsp;which is partly an illusion caused by two faint stars nearby-a 12th-mag-nitude one southwest of the core and a 13lh-magnitude star to the northeast. Aside from the dust lane, the most prominent feature lies northwest&nbsp;of the nucleus, where the galaxy's arms can first be seen as faint patches,&nbsp;then in three distinct spirals. The details in the southwest section are far&nbsp;more difficult and less defined. Look for some knots just outside the&nbsp;nuclear region connected by a looping arc.</p>
<p class="font49">Visually, the details of M66 are even more subtle than those of M65. Like the Black Eye Galaxy (M64), M66 appears very soft and graceful; it*s&nbsp;nothing like the strong and dynamic image you see in photographs. The&nbsp;galaxy's bright, starlike nucleus is its most noticeable feature. Use low&nbsp;power to compare the cores ofM65, M66, and NGC 3628. M65 has a somewhat stellar nucleus, and NGC 3628 reveals absolutely nothing! Now look&nbsp;for a bright knot immediately northwest of M66's nucleus. A dark patch&nbsp;lies east of the knot, followed by a mere stump of a spiral arm. The region</p>

This happens because the&nbsp;thick dust lane, which runs across the galaxy's entire length, overpowers&nbsp;the feeble light outlining it. So as you increase power, you magnify the&nbsp;dark lane, while spreading the Faint light across a larger area of sky; At&nbsp;magnitude 9.5, NGC 3628 shines almost as brightly as does M65 and M66,&nbsp;but it has a much lower surface brightness of 13.7.</p>

<p class="font49">M67 is a conspicuous naked-eye open cluster 2° west of 4th-magnitude Alpha (a) Cancri<span class="font30">・</span><span class="font49"> though it is often neglected for Cancer's brighter,&nbsp;showier Beehive Cluster (M44), 9° to the north. By way of comparison,&nbsp;M67 measures 25*across and shines at magnitude 6.0 (by my estimate),&nbsp;whereas M44 measures 70Across and beams more brightly at magnitude&nbsp;3.1. Try to detect these clusters simultaneously with the unaided eye,&nbsp;because they can give you a sense of intergalactic depth: M44 is 515 light&nbsp;years distant while M67 is 2,600 light years distant, or five times farther&nbsp;away! The diameter ofM67 is 19 light years - about twice that ofM44.</span></p>
<p class="font49">At somewhere between 4 and 5 billion years old, M67 is one of the most ancient open clusters known. The cluster contains more than 300&nbsp;stars between 10(h and 16th magnitude, and has a core density of 27 stars&nbsp;per cubic parsec. At 23 x, the cluster first appears as a loose and uniform&nbsp;sprinkling of bright stars across a carpet of fainter suns. But the view&nbsp;quickly changes into one of a slightly oval sphere of stars separated from&nbsp;another stellar clump to the south-southeast. Far afield, weak arms of&nbsp;stars fly off to the north, but are these associated with M67 or are they just&nbsp;chance alignments?</p><div>

<p class="font49">With a little imagination, the cluster looks as if it is dangling from a rack of three relatively bright field stars, the brightest member of which&nbsp;shines at 8th magnitude with incandescent yellow light. A dark rift runs&nbsp;east of that star, where it is rimmed to the north by a faint string of stars.&nbsp;More than the Beehive, M67 looks like a swarm of insects that seem partic-ularly attracted to the light of the yellow star. The faintest suns cannot be&nbsp;resolved in a 4-inch, but many huddle together in a &quot;nebulous&quot; mass. As a&nbsp;whole, M67's stars form a distinct reverse S-shaped pattern, whose&nbsp;swollen (hazy) midsection reminds me of a king cobra that has just swallowed a meal. A pointed arrow of stars in the southern stellar clump forms&nbsp;the snake's head, and the faint stream of stars to the north marks its tail.</p>

<p class="font49">If you have a good southern horizon, and are under dark skies&gt; M68 is a marvelously challenging naked-eye globular. I estimated the cluster's&nbsp;magnitude to be 7.6, which is 0.3 magnitude fainter than the published&nbsp;photometric value. The cluster, another MCchain discovery, is located in&nbsp;Hydra just 45<sup>,</sup>northeast of a 5^-magnitude star, and about 4° soutli-southeast of 2.6-magnitude Beta (P) Corvi. In fact, if you stare at that 5%-magnitude star and concentrate on M68's position, the duster might just&nbsp;pop out at you. With a dedicated effort, I could just make it out with the&nbsp;unaided eye and using averted vision, so it joins the ranks of M79 as being&nbsp;another of the fainter globulars visible without optical aid. Needless to&nbsp;say, M68 is a cinch in binoculars, unresolved yet obviously not a star.</p>
<p class="font49">At 23 x M68 is very compact but highly mottled, hinting at how nice it will appear at higher powers. Of this globular, Smyth wrote, “It is very&nbsp;pale but so mottled (hat a patient scrutiny leads to the inference that it has&nbsp;assumed a spherical figure in obedience to attractive forces/' lake a&nbsp;moment to look around the cluster with east up. Do you see how it sits in a&nbsp;V-shaped asterism, a bucket, to the west? Now look to the east; a chain of&nbsp;stars leading from the 5^-magnitude star seems to be attached to this&nbsp;bucket, drawing it up from a celestial well.</p>
<p class="font49">And the cluster certainly is beautiful at medium power. Dozens of “bright&quot; suns (the brightest being about magnitude 12.5) burst forth from&nbsp;a seething glow of faint stars that seem ready to boil out of the cluster's&nbsp;core. Indeed, the nuclear region displays a cauldron of bright suns, which&nbsp;at 130X, looks highly fractured. The brightest section is skewed to the&nbsp;northwest, where the stars concentrate in a wedge-shaped pattern.

<p class="font49">M71 was once an object of controversy among professional astronomers. Some argued it is a loose globular, while others claimed it's an extremely&nbsp;dense open cluster. There is no doubt today, however, that M71 is a globu-lar-a very near one, being only 13,000 light years distant, which is why it is&nbsp;so easily resolved and appears to lack the dense center typical of more&nbsp;distant globulars.</p>
<p class="font49">It is easily spotted midway between the bright stars Gamma (7) and Delta <span class="font30">⑹</span><span class="font49"> Sagittae, and a mere 20' northeast of 9 Sagitta, all in the shaft of&nbsp;the famous Celestial Arrow.

In a low-power field of view, M71&nbsp;occupies the center of an oval area outlined by four distinctive Y-shaped&nbsp;asterisms, all oriented in different directions. M71 itself is rather Y-shaped. especially if you include the two 12th</span><span class="font30">・</span><span class="font49">magnitude stars just&nbsp;outside its round and moderately condensed haze.

<p class="font49">M72 spreads across about 98 light years of space and. like M71. is classified as a very open globular. The clusters brightest members are&nbsp;near the limit of resolution in small apertures.

<p class="font49">'A trio of 10 mag. stars in a poor field&quot; is how an unimpressed Smyth described this unremarkable M object in his <span class="font49" style="font-style:italic;">Cycle of Celestial Objects. Z&nbsp;</span><span class="font49">shaped asterism conveniently situated 1%° east of M72, M73 is actually a&nbsp;grouping of four stars with no apparent connection, except that they lie in&nbsp;the same line of sight. Some sources still list it as an open cluster, but probably it is not. Such a chance grouping of four lOth-magnitude stars is not&nbsp;that improbable. Indeed, in his </span><span class="font49" style="font-style:italic;">Atlas of Deep-Sky Splendors</span><span class="font49"> Hans&nbsp;Vehrenberg notes that asterisms of this nature can be found in any part of&nbsp;lhe sky. I lowever, no detailed measurements have apparently been made&nbsp;of these stars, so the jury is still out on whether they are in some way&nbsp;related.</span></p>
<p class="font28">【<span class="font49">enjoy the shape and texture created by these four stars, because, if nothing else, (hey incite mental flights of fancy. Once, I brought a tape of&nbsp;Gustav Holsi's </span><span class="font49" style="font-style:italic;">The Planets</span><span class="font49"> with me into the field and played </span><span class="font49" style="font-style:italic;">Venus</span><span class="font49"> as I&nbsp;stared into the eyepiece.

Because the stars gradually fade to the&nbsp;west, the ship is seen obliquely from behind. The two bright end stars of&nbsp;the Y are the burning rockets. It's a stretch, granted, but for this object in&nbsp;particular a little flash is just whats needed!</span></p>
<p class="font49">I do not experience the same thrill of discovery that Messier must have felt when he encountered these stars, because even at 23 x in the4-inch M73 does not look fuzzy-in the sense of being cometlike, or nebular,&nbsp;as Messier described it. Obviously, the optics of Messier's telescope were&nbsp;not of the quality of optics in modern telescopes, and that is probably one</p><div><img src="Deep-sky companions the Messier objects by Stephen James OMeara (z-lib_files/Deep-sky companions the Messier objects by Stephen James OMeara (z-lib-196.jpg" style="width:60pt;height:54pt;"/></div><br clear="all"><div>
<p class="font49">reason why this grouping looked fuzzy to him; another reason could have been poor atmospheric conditions. So I went in search of another, more&nbsp;cometlike asterism suitable for the 4-inch. And I found one! Try sweeping&nbsp;your telescope at low power about 1° to the southwest of M73. Do you&nbsp;encounter a small haze? It is yet another asterism of four stars, in the&nbsp;shape ofaY. only this one is a mirror-image ofM73. These stars are closer&nbsp;together than those in M73. giving them a nebular appearance at 23 x.&nbsp;Archinal independently chanced upon these stars as well, and noted their&nbsp;similarity to the M73 grouping. This also corroborates Vehrenberg^&nbsp;comment that asterisms of this nature are not uncommon!</p>
<p class="font49">For another challenge, sweep your telescope 2° northeast of M73 and look for a slightly swollen 8lh-magnitude “star.&quot; This is the Saturn&nbsp;Nebula, a pale green planetary nebula. A 12.8-magnitude star blazes at the&nbsp;center of the nebula's 44&quot;x23&quot; disk. Use high magnification to see that&nbsp;central star.</p>
<p class="font49">I once had an opportunity to view this nebula through the great 60-inch reflector atop Mount Wilson in California. On that fine, moonless night in August 1986, the planetary displayed two sharply defined green&nbsp;oval disks surrounding the central star, which burned brightly at 400 x. On&nbsp;closer inspection, each ring had a series of condensations highlighting i<span class="font30">(</span><span class="font49">&nbsp;and two long rays with tight knots stretched beyond the ansae of the rings.&nbsp;The nebula bore a close resemblance to the planet Saturn seen edgewise,&nbsp;with bright moons adorning the lips of the hairline rings.</span></p><div>

<p class="font49">Blazing with the light of 40 billion suns, flinging spiral arms across 97,000 light years of space, M74 is a prima donna among open-face spiral galaxies. At least, that is how it comes across in long-exposure photographs&nbsp;taken through large telescopes. In small telescopes, it is more like a&nbsp;phantom, which is the nickname I have given it. No object in the Messier&nbsp;catalogue has proven more troublesome, more elusive, more provocative&nbsp;to amateur astronomers than this giant spiral. The problem is that the&nbsp;galaxy's large apparent size (10'.5) and very low surface brightness require&nbsp;a very dark sky fori<span class="font30">(</span><span class="font49"> to be seen well, ifat all! Mechain was right on the mark&nbsp;when he said, &quot;This nebula ...is quite broad, very dim, and extremely difficult to observe; it may be distinguished more accurately during fine&nbsp;frosts/* The fine frosts he refers to, 1 am sure, are those incredibly transparent evenings following the passage of a cold front, when the night sky is&nbsp;free from moisture and atmospheric contaminants, and the stars can be&nbsp;seen with crystal clarity away from city lights. On these nights you have&nbsp;the best chance to see dim and diffuse objects.</span></p>
<p class="font49">I searched for M74 many nights with Harvard Observatory*s 9-inch refractor without success. The fact is, so large an aperture under less-than-perfect skies doomed my quest before it even started. It's best to use&nbsp;a small-aperture instrument, low power, and a wide field of view on the&nbsp;finest of nights.</p>
<p class="font49">Locating the field is easy.

<p class="font49">ated by a pinpoint of light. With averted vision a diffuse outer skirt also takes shape. Jones believed that M74 could not stand anything but low&nbsp;power, but I disagree. If you can make out the galaxy's inner core, then that&nbsp;is the time to change to higher power. The core itself is mottled with the&nbsp;light of many dim stars, which emerge only with high powers. Il is this&nbsp;chance alignment of field stars projected against the nucleus that obviously caused John Herschel to mistake M74 for a globular cluster, which in&nbsp;turn led Dreyer to list it as a globular in the <span class="font49" style="font-style:italic;">New General Catalogue</span><span class="font49"> (see the&nbsp;NGCdescription earlier).</span></p>
<p class="font49">M74 is also a very difficult galaxy to sketch. Its spiral patterns are like spirits that weave in and out of view. So fleeting are these moments that I&nbsp;needed hours (and nights) of observing to confirm and reconfirm what I&nbsp;thought I was seeing. It is ironic that once I identified the field around M74&nbsp;in the telescope. I used 7X35 binoculars to spot the galaxy Imagine, here&nbsp;is the object I couldn't see with a 9-inch refractor from Cambridge,&nbsp;Massachusetts, yet here in my sparsely populated corner of Hawaii, it is&nbsp;visible in 7 x35s.

<p class="font49">gestions. I'd place it among the most surprising and mysterious objects in the Messier catalogue for viewing with backyard telescopes.</p>
<p class="font49">Certainly astronomers at the turn of the century must have been awed by its image in long-exposure photographs. Instead of a ghostly ring&nbsp;or disk of light encircling a central star-as is characteristic of planetaries-here was a 16th-magnitude central star in a <span class="font49" style="font-style:italic;">rectangular bar</span><span class="font49"> of light made&nbsp;up of two prominent nebulous patches (thus the double </span><span class="font49" style="font-style:italic;">NGC</span><span class="font49"> entry)&nbsp;flanked by an irregular array of luminous knots and nebulous arcs. In 1891&nbsp;Isaac Roberts suggested that M76s unusual character is due to our seeing&nbsp;ils broad ring of material edgewise. But the object's complex appearance&nbsp;might derive more from the way gases of varying densities near the central&nbsp;star illuminate and obscure the stars light.</span></p>
<p class="font49">M76 is about five times more distant than M27, but they are about the same actual size, so M76 only <span class="font49" style="font-style:italic;">appears</span><span class="font49"> smaller. Some catalogues&nbsp;severely underestimate the brightness of the Little Dumbbell, listing it as&nbsp;12th magnitude, which is much too faint. Indeed, as proof, M76 is at the&nbsp;limit of detectability in 7x35 binoculars, which is about 10th magnitude.&nbsp;At 23 x in the 4-inch, its small, opalescent disk reposes in a rich field of&nbsp;faint stars, many of which are pairs, less than 1° north-northwest of yellowish Phi @) Persei. To avoid passing over it with low power, sweep slowly&nbsp;and use averted vision. With peripheral vision the planetary seems to&nbsp;swell. This is not an illusion. Your eyes are picking up the faint light from&nbsp;the nebulous loops that connect to the four corners of the brighter rectangular bar.</span></p>
<p class="font49">At 72 x I found the Linle Dumbbell to resemble the Crab Nebula (Ml), probably because both objects display bright patches of nebulosity&nbsp;separated by a dark lane and bordered by misty frills. And these details are&nbsp;immediately apparent in M76. Despite its irregular appearance in photographs, the planetary looks symmetrical through small-aperture telescopes; there is an hourglass-shaped inner nebula, oriented northwest to&nbsp;southeast, with two semicircular arcs, one to the southeast, the other to&nbsp;the northwest- much like M27!</p>
<p class="font49">Interestingly, when I look at M76 with moderate power, the southwestern loop seems more pronounced, but at high power the northeastern one does. Although I can see the arcing extensions attached to each corner of the rectangle, the brightest sections (knots) within each loop are&nbsp;clearly separated from the hourglass. The hourglass itself is made up of&nbsp;bright knots, which could be Faint stars superposed on (he nebula. The&nbsp;southwestern half is the brighter. Rosse also detected &quot;subordinate&nbsp;nodules and streamers/* which led him incorrectly, though understandably, to deduce that this was a spiral nebula. There appears to be a hint of&nbsp;brightening <span class="font49" style="font-style:italic;">near</span><span class="font49"> the center of the rectangle, but do not confuse this isolated glow for the 16th-magnitude central star. As the drawing shows, M76&nbsp;has a heart of darkness (light in the negative rendering), and the central&nbsp;star hides in the deep recesses of that bleak cavity.</span></p><div>

<p class="font49">This object is the prototype of a peculiar class of extragalactic objects known as <span class="font49" style="font-style:italic;">Sey^fert galaxies.</span><span class="font49"> These systems have very active nuclei, which&nbsp;are potent emitters of radio-wavelength energy and whose spectra show&nbsp;strong emission lines - characteristics also displayed by the distant quasi</span><span class="font30">・</span><span class="font49">&nbsp;stellar objects known as </span><span class="font49" style="font-style:italic;">quasars.</span><span class="font49"> But quasars are infant systems billions of&nbsp;light years away, whereas energetic M77 is a mere 47 million light years&nbsp;distant. Apparently, gas clouds (some with the mass of 10 million suns) are&nbsp;blasting away from the nucleus of M77 with velocities up (o 360 miles per&nbsp;second and enough energy to power several million supernovae explosions! M77 is the only Seyfert galaxy in the Messier catalogue and is the&nbsp;closest you will come to seeing a quasar in action.</span></p>
<p class="font49">And, indeed, the nucleus of M77 is bright. You can see it shining like a 10<span class="font30">(</span><span class="font49">h-magnitude star about 1° southeast of 4th-magnitu</span><span class="font30">(</span><span class="font49">ie Delta (S) Ceti,&nbsp;just west of a real lOth-magnitude star; so at low power, and at first glance,&nbsp;the two look like a fine double star. But soon you will notice the faint halo&nbsp;of light surrounding M77, whose contribution raises the galaxy's brightness to 9ih magnitude. You will need moderate or high magnification to&nbsp;see the galaxy's peculiar arms, which long-exposure photographs reveal&nbsp;as (iglu and knotty dose to the brilliant nucleus but fainter and less tightly&nbsp;wound farther out. Burnham notes that the knots of the inner arms can be&nbsp;glimpsed through a 4-inch telescope on the finest nights, and he is&nbsp;absolutely right! In fact, these knots are what caused earlier astronomers&nbsp;like the Herschels and Smyth to perceive M77 as a resolved star cluster.&nbsp;Rosse noted it as a blue spiral. Can you detect any color?</span></p>
<p class="font49">After observing the galaxy on three different nights with the 4-inch at high power, I traced its inner spiral patterns with a high degree of confidence ^nd accuracy. A tiny but strong bar slices across the nucleus in an&nbsp;east-west direction and quickly curves away into tight but graceful arms&nbsp;In 1993 infrared images of M77 made at Kitt Peak National Observatory&nbsp;revealed a nebulous bar extending through the nucleus. The question is&nbsp;whether this infrared bar matches the bar seen visually. Most perplexing,&nbsp;at first, is the galaxy's northern arm, which appears to branch from a kno<span class="font30">(</span><span class="font49">&nbsp;close to the nucleus. You really have to study this area long and hard before&nbsp;you can begin to distinguish the individual arms from the nucleus. The&nbsp;difficulty is that these arms, like those of M66, are broken into knots and&nbsp;patches, so you have to find a way to piece the chaos together into a coherent picture. The trick is to use as much power as possible, to hyperventilate to heighten visual acuity (see page 23). and to play with the focus and&nbsp;use averted vision until you can cause the features to blend. Can you&nbsp;resolve the faint knot to the east of the nucleus, in the innermost spiral?</span></p><div>

<p class="font49">in neglecting this wonderfully mysterious object (more on the mysteries later).</p>
<p class="font49">Located about 2%° northeast of Zeta ([) Orionis, M78 is far enough away from the nebular madness surrounding Orion's Belt and Sword to be&nbsp;easily overlooked. In fact, M78 is the brightest of three specteriike glows in&nbsp;the region. Its companion nebulae, NGC 2067 and NGC 2071, are&nbsp;described subsequently. All three shine by reflected light from hot, young&nbsp;lype-B stars and are part of a greater complex of nebulosity sweeping&nbsp;through much of Orion. Most sources don't publish a magnitude for M7&amp;&nbsp;even though it is visible with 7x35 binoculars. The reason is that there are&nbsp;very few good measurements of nebula magnitudes. My magnitude estimate of 8.0 was made with binoculars. If you have good to excellent eyesight, challenge yourself by trying to detect it without aid.</p>
<p class="font49">A close pair of roughly 10th<span class="font30">・</span><span class="font49">magnitude stars burn at the heart of M78. Even at low power, they look like bloodless eyes peering back at you&nbsp;through a frosty window; Smyth and Webb described M78 as a wispy&nbsp;nebula, and Rosse saw spiral structure. Today its appearance is generally&nbsp;compared to a comefs. Indeed, the nebula does resemble a comet with a&nbsp;split nucleus, parabolic hood, and a tail that fans from south to east.&nbsp;(Anyone who has seen the sunward fan of Periodic Comet Encke will&nbsp;appreciate how closely M78 resembles that feature.)</span></p>
<p class="font49">Bui there are &quot;comets&quot; within this &quot;comet.&quot; Most striking is the l<sub>on</sub>g<span class="font30">(</span><span class="font49">ail of material flowing southeast of the southern nucleus. Look at&nbsp;</span><span class="font28">【</span><span class="font49">his tail under magnification and you will see </span><span class="font28">让 </span><span class="font49">has two parts: a short,&nbsp;stubby fan associated with one of the lOth-magnitude stars and a long,&nbsp;graceful tail associated with a 13.5-magnitude. The nucleus's northern&nbsp;component has a roughly 14th-magnitudc companion to the east,&nbsp;around which diffuse material streams out to form a &quot;flame&quot; of neb&nbsp;losity.</span></p>
<p class="font49">With high magnification focus your gaze immediately west of the <sub>(w0</sub> 10th-magnitude nuclei. At first you will see what appears to be a star,&nbsp;then uvo stars. But are these really stars? Perhaps (hey are knots of nebulosity. fhere is yet another very faint star or knot immediately to the&nbsp;southwest of the southern component. No image I have seen shows the&nbsp;inner details of M7&amp; so it has been difficult to confirm these sightings.&nbsp;Perhaps someone with a CCD camera and an image-processing program&nbsp;with unsharp masking can bring out these details.</p>
<p class="font49">As I alluded to earlier, M78 is not without certain mysteries. When I first looked at <span class="font28">让 </span><span class="font49">through the eyepiece, I expected, based on several written&nbsp;accounts, to see nebulosity surrounding two bright stars. But there were&nbsp;</span><span class="font49" style="font-style:italic;">three</span><span class="font49"> obvious stars (as noted in the </span><span class="font49" style="font-style:italic;">NGC</span><span class="font49"> description): the two dominant&nbsp;lOth-magnitude stars and a fainter one. Then 1 read in Luginbuhl and&nbsp;Skiff's book that the third star shines at magnitude 13.5. That seemed to&nbsp;match my visual impression, but when I returned to M78 a month later,&nbsp;the third star appeared fainter (han 13.5, perhaps by as much as a magnitude. In a 1975 </span><span class="font49" style="font-style:italic;">Astrophysical Journal</span><span class="font49"> paper, the star was measured to be&nbsp;magnitude 13.1. Could it be a variable star?</span></p>
<p class="font49">Here's something else to investigate. The nebula has a very faint, southern extension, superposed on which appears to be a vein of dark&nbsp;nebulosity forming what 1 call the “skeleton's wrist.&quot; Actually, the vvrist&nbsp;itself is not difficult to make out; it is the lane of darkness that separates&nbsp;the two southeast &quot;comet tails.&quot; The wrist, however, then branches into&nbsp;two extremely tenuous dark wisps: one cuts sharply to the south, the&nbsp;other, more difficult extension, goes southwest-the skeleton's thumb and&nbsp;forefinger.<span class="font28">【</span><span class="font49">saw these other features only once in several sessions. Can&nbsp;you see them?</span></p>
<p class="font49">While you are in the neighborhood of M78, check out these interest-ing NGC objects. Refer to the finder chart for their locations. NGC 2071 lo the northeast is an easy nebulosity, though it has a lower surface bright<span class="font30">・</span><span class="font49">&nbsp;ness than M78. At first glance the nebula appears round, but it is actually&nbsp;extended to the south and slightly east. See if you can detect it in binocu-lars. More intriguing is NGC 2067, which I noticed only by circumstance.&nbsp;°n one very gusty night, the Genesis was jittering slightly, setting the field&nbsp;in motion enough for my peripheral vision to catch sight of sharp-edged&nbsp;NGC 2067 to the northwest. There is yet another nebulosity -the minuscule (T.5X F) NGC 2064 to the southwest, which I have only suspected&nbsp;Thus it is not included in the drawing.</span></p><div>

<p class="font49">Needless to say, M79 is an easy target for binoculars - a 7.7-magni-tude fiizzball bracketed nicely by two 9th-magnitude stars. Even in the 4-inch at low power,<span class="font28">让 </span><span class="font49">is surprisingly small and tight, so tight that I once swept over it. mistaking the globular for a star. 1( is hard to believe that this&nbsp;seemingly insignificant patch of light spans some 75 light years of space.&nbsp;Then again, if you consider how rapidly the globular is receding from us -at about 143 miles per second - it is easy to imagine it diminishing from&nbsp;view, thus justifying its size in our sky;</span></p>
<p class="font49">At moderate power M79 has a distinctive starfish shape that is punc<span class="font30">・</span><span class="font49"> luated on its northern fringe by a 12th-magnitude star. I recall, as a&nbsp;teenager, seeing this shape through my 4^-inch reflector and lightheart-edly thinking how much it resembled a fly in a melting ice cube. One frigid&nbsp;evening many years later, as Lepus hopped above some distant fir trees at&nbsp;Oak Ridge Station in Harvard, Massachusetts. I turned a 16-inch reflector&nbsp;onto the globular and resolved i( right to the core.</span></p>
<p class="font49">Even ina4-inch telescope, M79 is a very satisfying cluster. It contains a smattering of fairly bright members against a blazing core, which was&nbsp;first described by both Smyth and Webb in the nineteenth century. The&nbsp;clusters boxy sides are obvious in both the inner and outer regions. The&nbsp;outermost reaches can be resolved at moderate power, even though the&nbsp;individual stars shine between 13th and 14th magnitude. The tightly&nbsp;wound center is a demon for small apertures. Any proper attempt at&nbsp;probing its depths requires high magnification, keen averted vision, and&nbsp;lots of patience.</p>
<p class="font49">If you spend enough time studying the nuclear region with high power, you might notice an asymmetry That is, the bright western side&nbsp;fades gradually and subtly toward the east. Part of the asymmetry results&nbsp;from the presence of a nice string of glittering stars on the northwest side&nbsp;of the nucleus. Furthermore, there's a gap between them, resulting in&nbsp;fewer stars on that side of the cluster. Two smaller stumps of starlight to&nbsp;the west and southwest add further lopsidedness to the interior.</p>
<p class="font49">The cluster also shows five &quot;arms&quot; extending in various directions. At first they will look fuzzy, but with increased magnification, they can be&nbsp;resolved into faint streams of stars. Most intriguing is the southwestern&nbsp;arm, which seems to consist of a series of thinning stellar arcs that drip&nbsp;toward a bright star (remember the melting ice cube?).</p>
<p class="font49">As the photograph shows, all these arms develop into crazy patterns of extremely faint outlying stars. I have yet to see these wild swirling patterns in the 4-inch. Perhaps one way to see them would be to use very high&nbsp;magnification and focus on each arm individually. I expect each search&nbsp;would consume hours. But if you feel up to the task, you could piece&nbsp;together a drawing that would rival the best photographs.</p><div><img src="Deep-sky companions the Messier objects by Stephen James OMeara (z-lib_files/Deep-sky companions the Messier objects by Stephen James OMeara (z-lib-212.jpg" style="width:247pt;height:293pt;"/></div><br clear="all">

One evening, about a&nbsp;decade ago, nova discoverer Peter Collins and 1 were strolling down a dark&nbsp;country road in Concord, Massachusetts - an old haunt of literary legends&nbsp;Thoreau, Emerson, and Alcott. As we approached a dark forest of oak and&nbsp;elm, we noticed the Great Bear just lurching over the treeline.

<p class="font49">He (hen asked if I could see them without the binoculars. Impossible, I thought, so I didn't give it much effort.</p>
<p class="font49">That night I did not see the galaxies without aid. But here in Hawaii, after years of trying from other locations, I have finally succeeded with&nbsp;M81. In fact, I estimated the galaxy's brightness with the naked eye to be&nbsp;magnitude 6.8 - the exact figure listed by Luginbuhl and Skiff! Now I have&nbsp;learned that Archinal independently sighted this galaxy without optical&nbsp;aid; he did it while on vacation under dark western skies at high altitude&nbsp;(12.000 feet). I hope these observations inspire you to try to broaden your&nbsp;naked-eye horizon by seeking out this Milky Way neighbor. Some catalogues underestimate the galaxy's brightness by a magnitude or inorc.&nbsp;And as for its distance, M81 and the equally distant galaxy M83 in Hydra&nbsp;are the farthest objects detectable with the naked eye in nature. At a distance of 4.5 million light years, M81 is twice as far away as both the&nbsp;Triangulum Galaxy (M33) and the Andromeda Galaxy (M31).</p>
<p class="font49">M81 and M82 lie about 2° east of 24 Ursae Majoris - a 4.6-magnitude star about a fist-width northwest of Alpha (a) Ursae Majoris. If you live&nbsp;under a dark sky, use binoculars first to locate the galaxy pair. The telescopic view is splendid: M81 's egg-shaped, 6.8-magnitude oval, about the&nbsp;apparent size of the full moon, sailing past the smaller, fainter (8.4-magni-tude), cigar-shaped ellipse of M82. These two galaxies, separated by a&nbsp;mere 38\ voyaged past one another about 200 million years ago with&nbsp;ominous consequences (the encounter is described a little later); now the&nbsp;galaxies are moving apart. Indeed, although they appear to be cosmic&nbsp;neighbors, M82 is 12.5 million light years more distant than M81.</p><div>
<h4><a name="bookmark118"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark119"></a>M82</span></h4></div><br clear="all">
<p class="font49">At 23 x in the 4-inch M81 looks enormously larger and more robust than M82. Immediately noticeable is M81's needle-sharp nucleus, which&nbsp;shines with a pale yellow light. Two Uth-magnitude stars burn just south of&nbsp;the core and can easily be mistaken for supernovae. Ironically, in 1993, a&nbsp;supernova in M81 blazed to prominence just west of these stars. Low power&nbsp;also reveals a mysterious <sup>M</sup>bar<sup>M</sup> of light crossing the nucleus, but this feature&nbsp;is probably nothing more than an enhancement of the spiral arms seen&nbsp;obliquely along the galaxy's major axis. Indeed, with a prolonged look the&nbsp;bar seems to point toward M82, which can force you to look at that neighbor galaxy. When I do that my averted vision suddenly picks up swooping&nbsp;spiral arms on either side of M81 !This is the magic of peripheral vision.</p>
<p class="font49">Something odd happens when I change to 72x. M82 increases in grandeur, while M81 loses some of its luster (because its faint outer arms&nbsp;have been overmagnified). But the biggest surprise comes at 130 x, when&nbsp;M81 <span class="font48" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">s</span><span class="font49"> core is transformed into a misty spring of light caressed by dark&nbsp;vapors, especially to the southeast where a prominent </span><span class="font49" style="font-style:italic;">lash</span><span class="font49"> of darkness&nbsp;abuts this region. Is this a paler version of M64's “black eye&quot;? The bright&nbsp;bar slicing through the nucleus is now contained in a tiny inner ring of&nbsp;nebulosity, the southwestern half of which appears brighter than the&nbsp;northeastern half. Delicate wisps of spiral arms surround the core, and&nbsp;together they look like a still photograph of a rotating lawn sprinkler. The&nbsp;mos</span><span class="font28">【</span><span class="font49">difficult detail to coax out (but the most rewarding once you see it) is&nbsp;lhe feathered texture of the spiral arm that lies midway between the outer,&nbsp;northeast arm and the burning core.

<p class="font49">The highly disheveled appearance of M82 stands in marked contrast with its properly groomed spiral neighbor. Here is an extragalactic radical,&nbsp;with spiked &quot;hairs&quot; bristling off a cigar-shaped body tattooed with dark&nbsp;matter. A very unusual galaxy, M82 appears in red-sensitive photographs&nbsp;to have a midsection that is bursting at the seams. Long filaments stream&nbsp;out at right angles from the galaxy's central region; the filaments can be&nbsp;traced out about 34,000 light years; the galaxy itself is only 55,000 light&nbsp;years long! Although M82 was once believed to be experiencing a violent&nbsp;explosion, astronomers now believe its central region is the site of intense&nbsp;starburst activity - containing perhaps 40 or so supernovae in the early&nbsp;stages of expansion. The first starburst episodes probably began 40&nbsp;million years ago, after M81, which is 10 times more massive than M82,&nbsp;ploughed past M82 like a speeding truck whizzing past a bicyclist. During&nbsp;that encounter, a strong wake of gravity would have smashed into M82.&nbsp;causing interstellar clouds to collapse and trigger new star formation.&nbsp;M82*s disrupted appearance probably results from interstellar material&nbsp;being gravitationally dragged away from its disk during that encounter.&nbsp;Newly formed supernovae, which usually flare up during episodes of star&nbsp;formation, could have also blasted material out of the galaxy's plane. As&nbsp;M81 sailed farther away from M82, the jostled interstellar medium of M82&nbsp;would have gradually fallen back onto its parent galaxy, triggering yet&nbsp;more starburst episodes, which we may still be witnessing today;</p>
<p class="font49">At moderate power in the 4-inch M82 is a stunning sight. It reminds me of a ghostly starship, cracked and floating through an interstellar&nbsp;graveyard. As Luginbuhl and Skiff note, the western half of the galaxy is&nbsp;distinctly brighter than the eastern half, though the brightest segment of&nbsp;the fragmented hull lies just east of a central darkening. The far eastern&nbsp;half fades ever so gradually, and it looks as if the galaxy is slowly vanishing&nbsp;before your eyes, being consumed by the universe. Better yet, you can&nbsp;imagine (his ghost ship snagged on a reef of stars <span class="font28">一 </span><span class="font49">the brighter western&nbsp;half of</span><span class="font28">【</span><span class="font49">he ship's hull sticking above water, and the fainter part submerged&nbsp;</span><span class="font30">)</span><span class="font49"><sub>n</sub> the shallows. When I really concentrate on the faint eastern extension,&nbsp;the brighter western half flares to prominence in my peripheral vision. It&nbsp;is really a very spooky galaxy.</span></p>
<p class="font49">As the drawing shows, M82 is highly complex and irregular. It takes time and patience to ferret out the details. Most impressive are the energetic-looking bursts of starlight running lengthwise through most of the&nbsp;galaxy. D*Arrest thought M82 scintillated &quot;as if with innumerable brilliant&nbsp;points/* At moderate power an obvious elliptical halo surrounds the&nbsp;galaxy's brightest parts. The core is very angular - a sight created by&nbsp;wedgelike lanes of dust. Dark matter prevails on opposing ends of the&nbsp;galaxy. But look closely at the galaxy's extreme western end. Do you see a&nbsp;notch and a kink of stars punctuated with a stellar period? Now, let your&nbsp;eye relax and use keen averted vision. Do you see the very faint &quot;explo-sions&quot; emanating from the center of the galaxy? Try with high power.</p>
<p class="font49">At low power, M81 and M82 share the field of view with two companions, one large and one small. The large one, NGC 3077. is a lOth-magni-tude elliptical galaxy 45' to the southeast of M81, and sports a hurricanelike center. About 1%° southwest of M81 is smaller NGC 2976, a&nbsp;lOth-magnitude spiral seen nearly edge on. Note the little curl on the side&nbsp;away from M81.</p>

<p class="font49">Without question. M83 is my favorite galaxy in the Messier list - a gorgeous face-on spiral. Being in Hawaii naturally enhances the grandeur of this far-southern object, which all too often wallows in atmospheric murk&nbsp;when seen from temperate latitudes. From my observing site M83 is powerfully condensed at low power in the 4-inch, easy in binoculars, and just&nbsp;visible to the naked eye. It is a true showpiece for small telescopes, displaying so much structure - bright knots, dark lanes, and oddly shaped&nbsp;arms- that it <span class="font49" style="font-style:italic;">begs</span><span class="font49"> for high power.</span></p>
<p class="font49">Unfortunately, M83 resides in a fairly nondescript part of Hydra, the longest constellation in the sky. so it is not the easiest object to get to. Look&nbsp;for its 7th-magnitude disk 3%<span class="font28">。</span><span class="font49">northwest of 1, 2, and 3 Centauri </span><span class="font28">一 </span><span class="font49">a tight&nbsp;equilateral triangle of bright stars about 20° (two fist-widths) south of lst-magnitude Alpha (a) Virginis. If you live under dark skies, use binoculars&nbsp;first to scout out the galaxy before employing your telescope. Adding to&nbsp;the wealth of the telescopic vista is a beautiful string of lOth-magnitude&nbsp;stars bordering the galaxy to the southeast and two fainter stars bracketing its farthest spiral arms. The galaxy immediately looks elongated&nbsp;southeast to northwest, with obvious patches on either side of lhe&nbsp;nucleus. One patch in the outer, southeast arm is glorious. And with time,&nbsp;several star-forming regions (nebulae) pop in and out of view all over the&nbsp;galaxy. You can spend many enjoyable hours just hunting them down.</span></p>
<p class="font49">To see the most detail, alternate between medium and high power. I use 72 x to see the faintest details in the arms and 130 x to pick out structure in the nuclear region. And I'm amazed at how incredibly detailed the&nbsp;nucleus and its surroundings appear in the 4-inch-how well defined even&nbsp;the tiniest bits of dark matter appear. The nucleus itselfis <span class="font49" style="font-style:italic;">tiny,</span><span class="font49"> looking like&nbsp;a star trapped in a maelstrom of shimmering light. While concentrating&nbsp;<sub>on</sub> (he nucleus. I notice that a bright knot in the southeastern arm&nbsp;becomes clearly apparent, as does another knot equidistant from the&nbsp;nucleus in the northwestern arm. The knots are oriented in a row that is&nbsp;skewed about 20° from the galaxy's main &quot;bar,&quot; which appears to extend&nbsp;across the major axis. The bar is composed of numerous nebulous&nbsp;patches along the galaxy's major axis and ultimately branches off the axis&nbsp;io form the stunning spiral arms. The sight reminds me of the great controversy over Lowell's canals on Mars: in imperfect seeing, the bar looks&nbsp;like a straight line of light, but under excellent concHtions, the line breaks&nbsp;<sub>u</sub>p into individual spots.</span></p>
<p class="font49">Once you can follow some of the spiral patterns (and this takes time), <sub>lr</sub>y focusing not on the bright arms themselves but on the dark matter&nbsp;between them. The challenge here is to make sense of the innermost&nbsp;region <span class="font28">一 </span><span class="font49">that maelstrom. I spent hours doing this, to confirm and reconfirm </span><span class="font48" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">wIkk</span><span class="font49"> I was seeing. &quot;lake it piecemeal - first look southwest of (he&nbsp;nucleus, where the arms appear brighter than those to the northeast.&nbsp;There is one beautiful dark lane, which I think is the most striking feature&nbsp;in the galaxy, just to the northeast of the nucleus. It looks like a black canal&nbsp;whose sandy banks are being illuminated by starlight. On the south side,&nbsp;use averted vision to see a broad arcing band of patchy nebulosity&nbsp;between (he nuclear pool and the closest spiral arm. Now spend time concentrating on that arm. When I do this, I discover that the nebulosity separates into two arms; one is more tightly wound than the other and lies&nbsp;closer to the nucleus. You need acute vision and resolution to separate&nbsp;these arms.</span></p>
<p class="font49">The vast and complex nerwork of spiral structure exhibited by M83 could possibly be explained, in part, by tidal warping from a collision with&nbsp;tiny NGC 5253, an elliptical galaxy 10 times less massive than M83 and&nbsp;which now lies about 2° to the southwest.</p><div>

<p class="font49">M84 is an SO system - a type of galaxy between an elliptical and a spiral - that resides in the Virgo Cloud of galaxies, the nearest of the large&nbsp;extragalactic populations.

<p class="font49">Ybu can find this curious pair about 5° northwest of Rho (p) Virginis. In the 4-inch both exhibit softly glowing disks with condensed centeis&nbsp;that gradually give way to diffuse outer haloes. But there are subtle differences. With low power M86 appears slightly larger and brighter than M84&nbsp;(8.9' in diameter and magnitude 8.9 versus 6'.5 long and magnitude 9.3,&nbsp;respectively). Curiously, my eye is first drawn to M84, whose stellar&nbsp;nucleus and tightly packed core appears more conspicuous than that ot&nbsp;M86. Moderate power does little lo improve the image. But 130 x reveals a&nbsp;14th-magnitude star southwest of M84*s nucleus, which enhances the&nbsp;prominence of the galaxy's core.

<p class="font49">After studying Hubble Space Telescope images of M87, astronomers now believe that a black hole with a mass of 3 billion suns lurks in the galaxys&nbsp;nucleus, within a zone about 120 light years across. High-resolution terrestrial images reveal a beaded jet of hot ionized gas, called plasma,&nbsp;(hough the brightest beads are barely within the visual range of large-aperture amateur instruments. Barbara Wilson and I spied evidence of the&nbsp;jet in her 20-inch reflector during a Texas Star Party. The jet extends nearly&nbsp;5,000 light years from M87 and points toward M84. It was once believed to&nbsp;be an intergalactic bridge between them, but the mysterious feature&nbsp;probably has a more interesting origin -the voracious black hole lurking&nbsp;al the center of M87, whose nuclear region is swarming with billions of&nbsp;rapidly orbiting suns. The black hole is already thought to have ingested&nbsp;clouds of gas (about 5 billion solar masses worth) and some whole stars, as&nbsp;well.

Lying about 47° southeast of 11 Comae Berenices, M88 is one of the more conspicuous spiral&nbsp;systems in the Virgo Cluster of galaxies.

<p class="font49">The Virgo Cluster harbors some 250 large galaxies and perhaps a thousand or more smaller systems. One distinguishing characteristic of this particular galaxy cluster is its smattering of spirals loosely dispersed&nbsp;among the more amorphous ellipticals. This peculiarity is nicely repre<span class="font30">・</span><span class="font49">&nbsp;sented by the pairing of M89 and M90</span><span class="font30">・</span><span class="font49"> an elliptical and a spiral, respectively. Separated by only 40', these galaxies should fit in the low-power&nbsp;field of almost any amateur instrument. Although their magnitudes are&nbsp;similar, M90 is bigger, bolder, and more interesting than its counterpart.</span></p>
<p class="font49">Deep images of M89 made by Australian astronomer David Malin (Anglo Australian Observatory) in 1979 with the UK Schmidt telescope&nbsp;reveal that the galaxy is much larger than was previously believed. The&nbsp;entire galaxy is surrounded by a faint but significant outer envelope that&nbsp;reaches out to about 150,000 light years distance. It was the first galaxy to&nbsp;be discovered with such a feature. Malin's discovery implies that a&nbsp;significant portion of M89*s mass exists in this low luminosity halo. This&nbsp;discovery would make M89's size comparable to M90*s, which also has a&nbsp;diameter of 150,000 light years and a mass of 80 billion suns. M90 is one of&nbsp;the larger spirals in the Virgo Cluster, though it may be of low density.</p><div>

It forms the northern apex of an equilateral&nbsp;triangle with the brighter galaxies M58 and M87.Tbhelp you further identify the pair, a line from M90 through M89 would bisect the equilateral triangle.

There is simply no bright nebula omitted by Messier that could conceivably be identified with M91.” Thus&nbsp;wrote a perplexed Owen Gingerich in a chapter he contributed io Mallas&nbsp;and Kreimer's <span class="font49" style="font-style:italic;">Messier Album.</span><span class="font49"> Gingerich opened a Pandora's box of possibilities.

<p class="font49">The most widely accepted explanation today is that Messiers 91si catalogue entry was actually NGC 4548, a lOth-magnitude barred spiral&nbsp;galaxy. So argued W C.

Located 5°&nbsp;southwest of Iota (t) Herculis, this 6.4-magnitude bolus is a surprisingly&nbsp;easy naked-eye catch, even though it is about a magnitude fainter than&nbsp;M13. One night I discovered that the two I Iercules globulars can be seen&nbsp;simultaneously with the unaided eye! Try this from your observing site,&nbsp;and see if you don't surprise yourself.

<p class="font49">At 23 x. M92 displays a very tight core and some definition in the outer halo; (hat is, it looks faintly granular and elongated north to south.&nbsp;But overall the globular appears much more compact than M13.&nbsp;Resolution begins at 72x, while 130x and averted vision transform the&nbsp;cluster into myriad points of light that appear to mushroom from a very&nbsp;tight core. The region immediately surrounding the core is not as uniform&nbsp;as it might first appear. In fact, I find il strongly asymmetrical to the north&nbsp;and shaped somewhat like a lobster claw. Close examination of the void&nbsp;between the claw's pincers reveals a very faint arc of stars enclosing the&nbsp;darkness to the west. So the void now looks like a keyhole. Streams of stars&nbsp;flow out of (he core and nearly wrap themselves around the cluster^&nbsp;northeastern part, which looks rather heart shaped. These streamers&nbsp;remind me of the wings of stars flowing from the core of M13, but in M92&nbsp;they are flowing in the opposite direction.</p>
<p class="font49">Not everyone will discern all of the features I have described here. The stars in M92 vary so much in brightness and are in such complex&nbsp;arrangemenis that I can only liken the view to a Rorschach test, the&nbsp;inkblot test used in psychology: al one moment I see a face-on spiral&nbsp;galaxy (Rosse, by the way, saw a spiral contour to the nucleus), at another,&nbsp;I see iwo rings of starlight perpendicular to each other. I blink and the&nbsp;lobster claw materializes.</p>
<p class="font49">Finally, to add to the confusion, M92 is riddled with dark lanes. In fact, when Isaac Roberts looked at his photographs ofM92 taken through&nbsp;a 20-inch telescope, he believed the cluster to be involved with dense&nbsp;dark matter that almost prevented stars from being seen through it. Aside&nbsp;from the keyhole, I believe I have found one other obvious dark pattern, a&nbsp;wishbone, in the northeast part of the cluster.</p>

Telescopically, the cluster fires the imagination. Smyth fancied a starfish pattern to the stars. (Smyth also shared a&nbsp;somewhat amusing story of how Chevallier d'Angos of the Grand Master's&nbsp;Observatory in Malta once mistook M93 for a comet, which caused Baron&nbsp;de Zach to call such astronomical blunders 'Angosiades.&quot;) Jones visualized a butterfly with open wings, and Skiff saw three rows of stars emanating from the center like &quot;trident spikes.&quot; To me, M93's V shape is part of a&nbsp;sunlit spider resting in the center of its dew-laden web, as you can see&nbsp;from my sketch.</p>
<p class="font49">M93 contains about 80 stars in a 10' field. Do you get the impression that (he two brightest stars in the southwest portion of the arrowhead</p>

<p class="font49">Despite its placid appearance, M94 may have experienced a violent explosion only 10 million years ago-a cleansing event that disgorged millions of solar masses of material out of its disk or nucleus. Episodes of violent&nbsp;behavior may be typical for spiral systems; if so, we are seeing this&nbsp;mundane-looking spiral in a quiescent state. Its disk is oriented nearly&nbsp;face on to us, and photographs through large instruments reveal its tightly&nbsp;wrapped arms, reminiscent of those in satellite views of a tropical hurricane.</p>
<p class="font49">This compact galaxy looms brightly about 3° northwest of the double star Alpha<sup>1</sup>-<sup>2</sup> (a<sup>1,2</sup>) Canum Venaticorum, or 1!^° northeast of the&nbsp;midpoint between Alpha and Beta (p) Canum Venaticorum. At 23 x. the&nbsp;galaxy can be seen in the neck of a Cygnus- or Gms-like asterism, shining&nbsp;with an almost starlike radiance, though a careful look will reveal it io be&nbsp;surrounded by a much larger, albeit fainter, glow.</p>
<p class="font49">The galaxy is a most intriguing sight at moderate to high power, because, with time, it seems to peer right back at you, like a hypnotic eye&nbsp;A near opposite of the famous Black Eye Galaxy (M64), whose central&nbsp;region is lined with dark material. M94 sports a faintly luminous ring that&nbsp;surrounds a sharp nucleus. This ring reminds me of the yellow circle&nbsp;around a crocodile's eye - a discriminating, all-the-better-to-see-you-with marking. (Can you make out the southern curl of this ring?) The crocodile metaphor is also fitting because, as described earlier, this is a&nbsp;-violent&quot; galaxy.</p>
<p class="font49">The 48-inch Schmidt camera on Palomar Mountain recorded another faint elliptical ring outside M94, perhaps debris blown out from&nbsp;the bellowing episode. It measures about 15' in diameter (M94 is only&nbsp;]I<span class="font30">，</span><span class="font49">2 in diameter on its major axis), has a sharp inner edge, and reveals a&nbsp;major axis skewed about 30° from that ofM94. One would think that this&nbsp;ring would be out of reach of amateur instruments, so why bother? Well,&nbsp;when I swept the 4-inch back and forth across that field several times at&nbsp;23 x, I convinced myself that this outer ring might be at the visual thresh-old. My drawing of its location, extent, and orientation, appears to be con</span><span class="font30">・</span><span class="font49">&nbsp;sisient with the one in the 48-inch image. Am 1 simply being misled by the&nbsp;power of suggestion? Or is this ring real and within reach of amateur&nbsp;instruments? Many times an object discovered with large telescopes turns&nbsp;out to be visible in small telescopes once knowledge of it exists. Ill let you&nbsp;be the judge.</span></p>

<p class="font49">M95 and M96, two spiral systems in Leo, fit comfortably together in the field of view of 7 x 50 binoculars, separated by only 42*. Huddling with&nbsp;them in the same field is the elliptical galaxy M105. They lie 8° west of&nbsp;another Leo galaxy trio, consisting ofM65, M66, and NGC 3628. All belong&nbsp;to a small cluster of galaxies known as the Leo Galaxy Group, whose&nbsp;members are speeding away from us a<span class="font30">(</span><span class="font49"> 800 miles per second.</span></p>
<p class="font49">M96 has been the focus of cosmologists* attention of late Astronomers used the Hubble Space Telescope (with its improved optics)&nbsp;to probe the galaxy's spiral arms in search of Cepheid variable stars. The&nbsp;period of a Cepheid's variability is strictly related to the intrinsic luminosity of the star. By comparing how bright a Cepheid looks with how luminous it really is, astronomers can determine the star's distance. Using this&nbsp;stellar yardstick on Cepheids in M96 and comparing them with those in&nbsp;the nearby Large Magellanic Cloud, astronomers determined that M96&nbsp;lies 38 million light years away- nearly 60 percent farther away than previously thought. (For consistency, however, the distances used in the data&nbsp;lists in this book were derived from the sources indicated in chapter 3.)&nbsp;This implies that <span class="font49" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font49"> the galaxies in the Leo Group might be that much&nbsp;more distant (han earlier calculations had put them.</span></p>
<p class="font49">You can find M95 and M96 lurking about 9° east of Regulus (Alpha |«l Leonis) and <span class="font49" style="font-style:italic;">Y/f</span><span class="font49"> northwest of5th-magnitude 53 Leonis. Although</span><span class="font28">【</span><span class="font49">did not&nbsp;estimate their magnitudes, my gut feeling is that both are brighter than&nbsp;the values listed for them (9.7 for M95, and 9.2 for M96). perhaps by a half&nbsp;magnitude or more. At low power M95 appears larger and more diffuse&nbsp;than its neighbor M96, whose core is much tighter.</span></p>
<p class="font49">M95 is a remarkable object that reminds me of Darth Vader's Death Ship in <span class="font49" style="font-style:italic;">Star Wars,</span><span class="font49"> because it has a round center with bars extending out to</span></p><img src="Deep-sky companions the Messier objects by Stephen James OMeara (z-lib_files/Deep-sky companions the Messier objects by Stephen James OMeara (z-lib-241.jpg" style="width:40pt;height:46pt;"/>

<p class="font49">This distinctive planetary nebula, so strongly reminiscent of the face of an owl (at least in photographs), is a real challenge for small telescopes&nbsp;because its faint light is spread over an area roughly five times the size of&nbsp;lupiter's apparent disk. Thus, to see the Owl Nebula well, one needs to be&nbsp;under a dark sky In <span class="font49" style="font-style:italic;">Messier's Nebulae and Star Clusters,</span><span class="font49"> Jones expounded&nbsp;on the difficulty of seeing this object. He noted that the glow will probably&nbsp;elude anyone using a telescope with an aperture smaller than 6 inches&nbsp;and that one needs at least a 12-inch instrument to see the &quot;eyes&quot; of the&nbsp;Owl. In that work the nebula is listed as 12th magnitude, though Jones said&nbsp;it is sightly brighter.</span></p>
<p class="font49">But 1 have to disagree with Jones about the Owl's elusiveness. M97 is one of the finer examples of a planetary nebula for a 4-inch telescope, displaying a pale but intricate shell of nebulosity You have to keep a fixed&nbsp;gaze, though, to see its delicate details. It earned lhe “Owl&quot; moniker from a&nbsp;sketch made by Rosse in 1848, who through his 72-inch telescope spied&nbsp;the two dark holes that look like eyes peering spookily from a round face.&nbsp;The Owl is certainly challenging, especially from a city, but I can recall&nbsp;seeing it many years ago from Cambridge, Massachusetts, with a 4-inch&nbsp;reflector. And Mallas definitely saw the Owl's eyes with a 4-inch refractor&nbsp;in the dark skies over Arizona. From Hawaii, M97 is <span class="font49" style="font-style:italic;">just</span><span class="font49"> visible in 7x35&nbsp;binoculars.

In&nbsp;binoculars the Owl forms the eastern arm of an asterism resembling the&nbsp;Southern Cross (Crux). Through the Genesis at 23 x the nebula is a strong&nbsp;ball of light surrounded by a thinner, weaker shell, which is slightly off-center -reminiscent of a composite print out of registration.</span></p>
<p class="font49">To see the innermost detail you have to experiment with different eyepieces and determine which one gives you the highest magnification&nbsp;without adversely diminishing the object^ brightness. Jumping back and&nbsp;forth from 72x to 130X works best for me. At medium power the gig,&nbsp;from the Owl promptly appears as a nonunifbrm disk. Every now and then&nbsp;the 14th-magnitude central star pops into view, but I have seen it only&nbsp;occasionally with averted vision. It may be the single most challenging&nbsp;feature in the entire nebula. (If you do see it, take a moment to consider</p><div>

The two galaxies present a nice morphological contrast together in the low-power field of view. Another way&nbsp;to locate M99 is to look 50' southwest of the 5.1-magnitude star 6 Comae&nbsp;Berenices, 2° northeast of which beckons M100.</span></p>
<p class="font49">In photographs made with large-aperlurc instruments M99 shows two thin spiral arms that fly off to the west from the main central mass and&nbsp;one strong arm that arches far to the east. Several minor tufts of starlight&nbsp;also stray off the nuclear region to the west. The telescopic image in the 4-inch is but a pale ghost of that mighty spectacle. Yet details do emerge with&nbsp;effort.</p>
<p class="font49">At 23 x a beadlike nucleus is set inside a round, unassuming outer glow. Increasing to moderate magnification transforms M99 into a subtle&nbsp;beauty. The two strongest arms materialize slowly; soon displaying grace-ful knots that look like diamonds balanced on a fingertip. This is a 9.8-magnitude galaxy with an angular size of 5'.4X4'.7 and a low overall&nbsp;surface brightness. The quality of your skies may well determine whether&nbsp;or not you see any spiral structure at all. Roger Clark in his book, <span class="font49" style="font-style:italic;">Visual&nbsp;Astronomy of the Deep Sky,</span><span class="font49"> reported seeing °no hint&quot; of spiral detail in his&nbsp;8-inch Cassegrain under &quot;moderate to good&quot; sky conditions.</span></p>
<p class="font49">Astronomically, M100 is one of the larger spiral systems in the Coma-Virgo Cloud of Galaxies, comparable in size to our own galaxy;&nbsp;Through a telescope, however. M100 has little to offer. Although al magnitude 9.4 it is brighter than M99, it is nevertheless a more difficult object&nbsp;because its light is spread over an even larger surface area (7'.4 x 6\3). It&nbsp;remains a pale orb even with high magnification, though perseverance&nbsp;will show traces of ghostly arms. Photographically, M100 is supremely tex-</p><div>

<p class="font49">Just look at the drawings of the various galaxies throughout this book. I find it remarkable that I can look at an oblique galaxy such as M9&amp;&nbsp;55 million light years away, and resolve more detail more easily than I can&nbsp;for a face-on galaxy like M74, which is 23 million light years closer. This is&nbsp;similar to the effect one sees when lQoking at a planetary nebula's spherical shell of gas, where more light can be seen on the outer edge than in the&nbsp;center because more material is concentrated in our line of sight on the&nbsp;edge.</p>
<p class="font49">In 1995 near-infrared images of M100 released by astronomers working on Mauna Kea in Hawaii and on La Palma in the Canary Islands&nbsp;revealed stubby spiral arms close to the nucleus that appear to be rotating&nbsp;in the opposite direction of arms farther out in the giant spiral. The&nbsp;astronomers suggested that these represent regions of new star formation, where hot young stars are being forced into independent orbits.&nbsp;There is a lack of symmetry in the brightest features of M 100's disk, which&nbsp;might suggest that the galaxy is being tidally warped by its neighbors. The&nbsp;most surprising image of Ml00, however, came in late 1993, when the&nbsp;newly repaired Hubble Space Telescope turned its Wide Field and&nbsp;Planetary Camera onto the galaxy's core, revealing a vortex of blue and&nbsp;yellow suns that looks like a galaxy within a galaxy.

<p class="font49">Stars in an open cluster are destined to be fickle. Without the &quot;glue” <sub>O</sub>f strong mutual gravitation to hold them together - as the hundreds of&nbsp;thousands of stars are held together in a globular cluster - they gradually&nbsp;separate from the main pack and form other alliances. Or, like our sun&nbsp;travel solo through the emptiness of space. When we look at a loose cluster&nbsp;of stars through a telescope, then, it is difficult to judge what state of association, or disassociation, it is in. The last object in Messier's original catalogue, M103 in Cassiopeia, is a case in point. Astronomer Harlow Shapley&nbsp;went so far as to call this stellar sprinkle a possible chance alignment of&nbsp;stars. But recent data suggest that M103 is a true cluster with as many <sub>as&nbsp;</sub>172 stars in an area of only 6' of arc.</p>
<p class="font49">Located about 1° northeast of Delta (8) Cassiopeia, the cluster is easily spied in 7x35 binoculars, which also resolve the cluster's brighter&nbsp;stars, the brightest being magnitude 10.5. The view through the telescope&nbsp;is really best at low power, when the loose grouping appears more&nbsp;compact. When I place brilliant Delta on rhe western side of ihe low-power field of view, M103 lies between i( and a congregation of four other&nbsp;open clusters to the east! What a dynamic field, even if these clusters are&nbsp;not related.</p>
<p class="font49">M103 is clearly the brightest of the five clusters, and it is easily distinguished by its Christmas-tree shape. The luminous star at the apex of the tree is Struve 13L a double star with 7.3- and 10.5-magnitude components separated by nearly 14&quot;; Smyth saw their colors as straw and dusky-blue. Apparently this double is not a true member of the cluster, though.</p>
<p class="font49">Smyth also saw a red 8th-magnitude star southwest of the brightest star in the cluster. D*Arrest described this same star shining with a rose&nbsp;<sub>t</sub>j<sub>n</sub>t, but he recorded it as <span class="font49" style="font-style:italic;">10th</span><span class="font49"> magnitude. Luginbuhi and Skiff describe it&nbsp;as &quot;very red&quot; and shining at magnitude 8.5. Photometric measurements&nbsp;confirm that the star is fairly red. And as for me, curiously, I saw no reddish&nbsp;color at all.</span></p><div><img src="Deep-sky companions the Messier objects by Stephen James OMeara (z-lib_files/Deep-sky companions the Messier objects by Stephen James OMeara (z-lib-261.jpg" style="width:67pt;height:42pt;"/></div><br clear="all"><div>

<p class="font49">Picturesque Ml04 is an enigma.

M96 is on the other side of&nbsp;the spectrum, with a large bulge but relatively insignificant arms. Like&nbsp;M96, Ml04 displays a dominant central bulge in long-exposure photographs, but this nearly edge-on system also shows a preponderance of&nbsp;interstellar gas and dust, which is characteristic of a more evolved spiral&nbsp;galaxy, somewhere between M96 and M74 in the classification scheme.&nbsp;Another quizzical finding was made by Vesto Slipher of Lowell&nbsp;Observatory, who in 1913 became (he first astronomer to detect rotation&nbsp;in a galaxy other than our own.

<p class="font49">Messier's contemporary, Pierre Mechain. discovered M105 on March 24, 1781. But the object was not included in Messiers list until 1947, when&nbsp;Canadian astronomer Helen Sawyer Hogg suggested adding it (as well as&nbsp;the galaxy M106 and globular star cluster M107), because notations in&nbsp;Messier's copy of the printed catalogue suggested he was aware of them.&nbsp;The galaxy has long been regarded as a dynamically ordinary elliptical&nbsp;(El) that rotates slowly about its apparent minor axis, though more&nbsp;modern observations with the Multiple Mirror Telescope and Hubble&nbsp;Space Telescope reveal that it may be a nearly face-on SO galaxy inclined&nbsp;about 90 degrees from edge on.

<p class="font49">In photographs M106 looks like a scarred survivor of galactic violence, and it is. Like M94. (his oddly shaped spiral has experienced episodes of&nbsp;violent upheaval in its past. Indeed, we seem to have caught the nucleus&nbsp;in the throes of an enormous explosion, which has strewn several tens of&nbsp;millions of tons of matter across the plane of the galaxy. Its arms are&nbsp;bruised with rich star-forming regions in a mildly chaotic stew of galactic&nbsp;turbulence. Even the galaxy's outer arms look as if they have been&nbsp;stretched like taffy until they nearly snapped free of the main body. Radio&nbsp;images reveal still other arms beyond the limp visual appendages. In 1992&nbsp;it was announced that, though M106 is seen nearly face on, a disk of gas&nbsp;and dust surrounding the galaxy's core is seen nearly edge on. Then in&nbsp;1994 a team of radio astronomers discovered a black hole near the galaxy 's&nbsp;nucleus.

In binoculars it glows faintly&nbsp;2° south of 3 Canum Vienaticorum. Its saucer-shaped nuclear region&nbsp;immediately challenges viewers with its complex, mottled texture. The&nbsp;galaxy has essentially the same orientation in space as does the Great&nbsp;Andromeda Galaxy (M31), but only half the mass.</p>
<p class="font49">The outer arms ofM106 have a distinct S shape and are easy to follow at 23 x in the 4-inch. Despite its symmetry, the northern half of the galaxy&nbsp;looks brighter to me than the southern half.</p>
<p class="font49">The inner arms also have an S curvature to them, though tighter. So here we have two Ss superposed on one another - one large, one small.&nbsp;Now use high power to study the nuclear region, especially the area&nbsp;around the central condensation.

MllOis the larger of the two prominent elliptical satellite galaxies&nbsp;that flank the majestic Andromeda Galaxy (M31), the smaller and closer&nbsp;one being M32. M110 hovers northwest of M31, appearing as a fuzzy oval&nbsp;glow with a total visual magnitude of 8.0 but a much fainter actual surface&nbsp;brightness of 13.9 because of its large size (21*.9x 1T.0).</p>

Furthermore, the&nbsp;east and west sides of the inner halo exhibit concentrations that are&nbsp;clearly separated from the nucleus. Thus, MllO's nucleus appears ringed&nbsp;by arcs of diffuse starlight, which makes the following description of Ml 10&nbsp;by Heber Curtis of Lick Observatory very intriguing: &quot;The bright central&nbsp;portion ...
