<p class="font49">A fragile observing log, yellowed with age, lay protected under glass in the main hall of the Paris Observatory, a room crowded with old telescopes&nbsp;that whispered memories of starlit nights long past. On the log's pages, in&nbsp;words written more than two centuries earlier, the great comet hunter&nbsp;Charles Messier commented on the weather, sky conditions, how his&nbsp;observing sessions went, and his plans for a new telescope. The thought&nbsp;occurred to me that Times really haven't changed. The concerns he had&nbsp;then are my concerns today, and the feeling he must have had as he&nbsp;peered through his telescope at some unknown fuzzy object, his brief&nbsp;moment of tension - could it be a comet?-isa feeling I know well from my&nbsp;own comet searches. As I read Messiefs words, the years began to fall&nbsp;away. There he was, surveying the sky from the tower of the Hotel de&nbsp;Cluny, sorting out comets from unknown nebulae and star clusters, and&nbsp;there I was right next to him.</p>
<p class="font49">Charles Messiefs story is a prime example of serendipity in astronomy: we remember him today more for his catalogue of noncometary celestial objects than for the comets he discovered. Yet Messier was the&nbsp;first person to discover comets as part of an organized search for them. To&nbsp;optimize his search efforts he kept a list of nebulous objects that merely&nbsp;masquerade as comets so that he and others would not be fooled by them&nbsp;more than once. The 12 comets he is credited with discovering are all long&nbsp;gone, but his catalogue of more than 100 deep-sky treasures remains a&nbsp;collection of some of the finest showpieces in the heavens.</p>
<p class="font49">My own hunt for the Messier objects began in August 1962, with Echo, my 3-inch reflector telescope, and the Andromeda Galaxy as my&nbsp;first quarry. Using a nearby 4th-magnitude star coupled to two fainter&nbsp;stars as an arrow, I moved the telescope gently across two or three fields&nbsp;of view. Suddenly my eye caught sight of a bright patch of fuzzy light.&nbsp;There it was, my first Messier object, right where it belonged. It may&nbsp;have looked like only a cloud in the sky, but I would read that its light&nbsp;had left that galaxy more than a million years ago (today we know it's&nbsp;more than 2 million). And that made the experience one I would never&nbsp;forget.</p>
<p class="font49">There can be no better exercise for a beginning astronomer than to And and observe all of the Messier objects. It is the best way to get&nbsp;acquainted with the riches the night sky has to offer. The stunning beauty&nbsp;of the Orion Nebula (Messier 42), the delicate wispy stmeture of the&nbsp;Omega Nebula (Messier 17), and the vastness of the Andromeda Galaxy</p>
<p><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;">Foreword </span><span class="font49">(Messier 31) just hint at the grandeur represented by these gems of deep&nbsp;space.</span></p>
<p class="font49">Charles Messier would have been proud to know the author of this book. Without a doubt, Steve O'Meara is one of the best visual observers in&nbsp;the world today. In 1985 he became the first person to see Halley's Comet&nbsp;since 1911 - a full seven months before anyone else saw it. (Messier&nbsp;himself had wanted to be the first to herald Halley's Comet's 1758 return,&nbsp;but another observer beat him to it.) Steve's acute planetary observations&nbsp;are highly regarded, and his intricate drawings of deep-sky objects are&nbsp;superb. Steve has written a book that will guide you through the sky to&nbsp;meet the Messier objects one by one. Finding them is both fun and challenging; this book will turn that challenge into a memorable, and perhaps&nbsp;even a lifelong voyage of discovery.</p>

<p class="font49">l\vo and a half centuries ago a French comet hunter named Charles Messier began compiling a catalogue of nebulous sky objects. He explained</p><img src="Deep-sky companions the Messier objects by Stephen James OMeara (z-lib_files/Deep-sky companions the Messier objects by Stephen James OMeara (z-lib-5.png" style="width:236pt;height:12pt;"/>
<p class="font49">What caused me to undertake the catalogue was the nebula I discovered above the southern horn ofTaurus on 12 Sept. 1758,&nbsp;while observing the comet of that year.... This nebula had such&nbsp;a resemblance to a comet, in its form and brightness, that I&nbsp;endeavored to find others, so that astronomers would not confuse&nbsp;these same nebulae with comets just beginning to shine.</p>
<p class="font49">Messier died long before twentieth-century astronomers realized the profound nature of these hauntingly diffuse glows. The 110 &quot;Messier objects/<sup>1 </sup>it turns out, are an eclectic collection of celestial treasures: 39 galaxies, 57&nbsp;star clusters, 9 nebulae, a supernova remnant, a swath of Milky Way, a tiny&nbsp;grouping of stars, a double star, and even a duplication. The list includes&nbsp;the most massive and luminous galaxy known, the ghostly remains of a&nbsp;cataclysmic stellar explosion, and an immense cosmic cloudscape that&nbsp;cradles newborn stars in dense cocoons of hydrogen gas.</p>
<p class="font49">Every Messier object is within reach of a small telescope, and many are visible with binoculars and the naked eye, especially under clear, dark&nbsp;skies far away from city lights. Amateur astronomers of all ages enjoy tackling the Messier catalogue members, because they represent a good sampling of whats “out there<span class="font30">；</span><span class="font49">' and because finding them helps to hone&nbsp;observing skills. In a sense, the Messier objects are the testing grounds for&nbsp;budding skywatchers.</span></p>
<p class="font49">The Messier objects entered my life in 1966, when I was 10 years old. They were mentioned in the <span class="font49" style="font-style:italic;">Sky Observer's Guide,</span><span class="font49"> a Golden Guide by R.&nbsp;Newton Mayall and Margaret Mayall, whose words also taught me the&nbsp;basics of astronomy. I quickly located the brightest Messier objects from my&nbsp;back porch in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Then one winter evening a friend&nbsp;loaned me his 2-inch refractor. I recall pointing its white enameled tube&nbsp;<sup>over a</sup> frozen city landscape, beyond the smoking chimneys, and seeing&nbsp;swirls of nebulosity surrounding the Trapezium, a group of young, bright&nbsp;stars in the mighty Orion Nebula (Messier 42, or M42), then the knitted stars&nbsp;of ihe Pleiades (M45) - Lord Tennyson's <sup>M</sup>glittering swarm of fireflies tangled&nbsp;in a silver braid.&quot; These views were visual poetry, and like Tennyson and&nbsp;countless others before him, I became captivated by the allure of the stars.</span></p>
<p class="font49">Several years later, when I acquired a 4%-inch reflector, another friend gave me a box of S<span class="font28">幼 &amp; </span><span class="font49" style="font-style:italic;">Telescope</span><span class="font49"> magazines - a monthly publication&nbsp;devoted to the hobby of amateur astronomy. An article immediately&nbsp;caught my eye; it was one in a series by John Mallas and Evered Kreimer&nbsp;spotlighting the Messier objects. Each article featured drawings by Mallas&nbsp;and photographs by Kreimer, as well as visual descriptions and brief histories of the objects. On the first clear night I eagerly set up the scope, and&nbsp;with magazines and red flashlight in hand, I followed along with Mallas&nbsp;and Kreimer as they toured the “M&quot; objects. No longer feeling alone in my&nbsp;pursuits, I began dedicating one clear night to each Messier object -studying it, writing down impressions, and making drawings.</span></p>
<p class="font49">That Mallas and Kreimer series was later compiled into a book called <span class="font49" style="font-style:italic;">The Messier Album,</span><span class="font49"> which served the astronomical community for many&nbsp;years to follow. But time has marched on. The optical quality of many&nbsp;commercially available telescopes and eyepieces is superior to the telescope Mallas used a quarter-century ago, providing sharper images and&nbsp;revealing fainter details. We also have more accurate astronomical information today about many of the objects - their sizes, distances, magnitudes, and more - than we did when </span><span class="font49" style="font-style:italic;">The Messier Album</span><span class="font49"> was written.&nbsp;Object positions and maps have been updated to equinox 2000.0 coordinates from the equinox 1975.0 coordinates used by Mallas and Kreimer.&nbsp;Clearly, the time was right for a fresh new look at these classical astronomical specimens.</span></p>
<p class="font49">As observers today, we are not only better equipped but also wiser. Looking back, it is hard to believe that Mallas used a 4-inch f/15 refractor to&nbsp;make his observations. Although a popular telescope type in its day, it was&nbsp;best suited for studying the moon and planets. Today's deep-sky observers&nbsp;prefer rich-field telescopes over long-focus refractors. It is also amazing&nbsp;that Mallas made his observations from a Los Angeles suburb tainted by&nbsp;light pollution and smog! These problems are even more pervasive today&nbsp;and represent an insidious threat to our continued enjoyment of the&nbsp;heavens. More and more, residents of cities and suburbs must pack their&nbsp;gear and drive some distance from their homes to less populated areas to&nbsp;enjoy a night under the stars. And several times a year thousands of&nbsp;amateur astronomers journey to national conventions and star parties&nbsp;held at first-class, dark-sky sites. In fact, one such journey inspired this&nbsp;book.</p>
<p class="font49">For a week in May 1994,1 attended the Texas Star Party, a deep-sky observing event held on the Prude Ranch near Fort Davis, Texas, at an altitude of just over 5,000 feet. One sparkling-clear night, Al Nagi er, founder&nbsp;ofleleVue Optics, showed me a wide-field view of the Milky Way <span class="font28">一 </span><span class="font49">specifically, the region known as M24 - through his 4-inch Genesis refractor. The&nbsp;field was bristling with starlight and threads of dark nebulosity. I didift&nbsp;want to take my eye from the telescope. Later that week, I boi rowed&nbsp;another Friend's Genesis and spent three hours studying the Whirlpool</span></p>
<p class="font49">Galaxy (M51) in Canes Venatici; 1 spent many more hours on subsequent nights. The graceful spiral arms, the numerous punctuating knots- all the</p><div>
<p class="font49">subtle detail was awesome to behold. I began to wonder what the other</p></div><br clear="all">
<p class="font49">Messier objects would look like through a telescope of uncompromising quality, with superior eyepieces, and viewed from the darkest sites on&nbsp;earth. Thus, I decided to revisit, one by one, the deep-sky gems that&nbsp;Charles Messier catalogued more than two centuries ago, and that started&nbsp;n<span class="font28">】</span><span class="font49">e on what was to become my latest adventure in an already long and&nbsp;exciting career in astronomical observation, teaching, and writing. The&nbsp;result is this book, which I hope will inspire and inform you as much as&nbsp;less others who have used (hem.</span></p><div>
<p class="font49">Mallas and Kreimers seminal articles and book did for me and the count-</p></div><br clear="all">
<p class="font49">The purpose of this book is to provide new <span class="font49" style="font-style:italic;">and</span><span class="font49"> experienced observers with a fresh perspective on the Messier objects. Chapter 1 is a&nbsp;brief account by world-renowned comet discoverer David Levy of the life&nbsp;of Charles Messier, a comet hunter himself, and how his catalogue of&nbsp;deep-sky curiosities came to be. Chapter 2 introduces beginners to the&nbsp;basics of skywatching and to some important terms and concepts. It is&nbsp;designed specifically to help newcomers orient themselves to the sky and&nbsp;start locating the brightest Messier objects. In chapter 3, &quot;The Making of&nbsp;This Book,&quot; I review the methods and the equipment with which I conducted the observations described herein and provide additional information about the book's content.</span></p>
<p class="font49">Of course, the heart of this book is chapter 4, which looks in detail at each Messier object. Since this book is a “companion,&quot; I've used a conversational tone<span class="font30">：</span><span class="font49"> I speak (o you as if I'm with you in the field. Along with the&nbsp;descriptive text, I have provided for each object a list of essential data&nbsp;including its coordinates, size, brightness, and distance. The equinox&nbsp;2000.0 finder charts have been carefully drafted to work together with Wil&nbsp;Tirion's all-new, wide-field constellation map at the back of the book;&nbsp;together they will enable you to quickly zero in on your targets. A new and&nbsp;comprehensive translation of Messiefs original published catalogue was&nbsp;commissioned and is included here. It supersedes earlier translations,&nbsp;which often were abridged and prone to occasional errors and misinterpretations. I have also included, in appendix A, the endnotes to Messier's&nbsp;original catalogue, in which he lists a number of objects reported by other&nbsp;observers (hai he tried, but failed, to find himsclf.</span></p>
<p class="font49">The detailed drawings I made of the Messier objects are another distinctive feature of this book. Each drawing was based on several hours of observing each object over several extremely transparent nights. 1 think&nbsp;you will find these illustrations revealing and useful in helping you to see&nbsp;subtle details in (he objects that you may not have noticed before (and&nbsp;which may not be apparent in photographs). I have also updated and&nbsp;revised many of the objects* magnitude estimates, offered thoughts about&nbsp;some of the &quot;missing&quot; Messier objects, and distributed observing challenges throughout the chapter.</p>
<p class="font49">In chapter 5, Some thoughts on Charles Messier, I offer some summarizing thoughts or &quot;analysis&quot; on Messier and his catalogue, which I felt compelled to do having spent so much time thinking about the man and&nbsp;what he saw - and didn't see. I also felt compelled to describe, even in a&nbsp;book devoted to the Messier catalogue, 20 of my favorite zjo/rMessier&nbsp;objects, in chapter 6. Consider them honorable mentions to the catalogue&nbsp;that are conspicuous by their absence from it and certainly deserving of a&nbsp;look while you're out hunting Messier objects.</p>
<p class="font49">The appendices contain additional information that you will find useful, including a brief discussion about &quot;Messier marathons/* a guide to&nbsp;navigating the Coma-Virgo Cluster, and a suggested reading list.</p>
<p class="font49">Perhaps the most unique aspect of this book, and what I most want to convey, is the <span class="font49" style="font-style:italic;">approach</span><span class="font49"> I take to observing. It's an approach based on&nbsp;creative perception and on using the imagination to see patterns and&nbsp;shapes in the subjects seen through the eyepiece. It involves using not just&nbsp;your eye but also your </span><span class="font49" style="font-style:italic;">mind's eye</span><span class="font49"> to associate those patterns and shapes&nbsp;with things that are familiar to you, to create pictures and even stories.&nbsp;Rather than barrage you with just facts (of which you get plenty),! thought&nbsp;you'd also enjoy seeing these objects in new ways - especially the clusters,&nbsp;whose multitude of inherent shapes lend themselves to being seen as&nbsp;celestial Rorschach tests. By using the imagination you can add another&nbsp;dimension to your observing </span><span class="font28">一 </span><span class="font49">a highly personal and entertaining one&nbsp;(after all, this is a hobby). Anyone who has read </span><span class="font49" style="font-style:italic;">Hard Times</span><span class="font49"> by Charles&nbsp;Dickens will understand rr</span><span class="font30">)</span><span class="font49">y protest of a diet consisting totally of fact. (By&nbsp;teaching youngsters fact not fancy, conformity not curiosity, Dickenss&nbsp;bleak character Thomas Gradgrind tried to stifle inquisitive minds.) If you&nbsp;have never gazed at the ethereal quality of a Messier object through a telescope, I encourage you to look upon them as you would a painting or a&nbsp;piece of art - and let that art add meaning to your experience.</span></p>
<p class="font49">It is my hope that this book will not only introduce you to the objects themselves - or reintroduce you, as the case may be - but that it will also&nbsp;challenge you to raise your observing skills to a higher level and to push&nbsp;your visual limits. I hope it compels you to search for new and mysterious&nbsp;aspects about these objects, to see them in rich and creative ways, and to&nbsp;grow as an observer.</p>
<p class="font49">I know the magic of the Messier objects because I have been under their spell for three decades, loday I see the same magic in my wife's eyes,&nbsp;whenever she raises her binoculars to the sky and happens upon her&nbsp;&quot;comets.&quot; May the spell never be broken.</p>

<p class="font49">“If I have seen so far, it is because 1 have stood on the shoulders of giants.&quot; Like Sir Isaac Newton and others before and after him who used this&nbsp;axiom, I would like to recognize the giants who have helped me in my&nbsp;observational and literary journeys.</p>
<p class="font49">Highest tribute goes to the late Walter Scott Houston, who shared his observing experiences and techniques in his Deep-Sky Wonders column&nbsp;<span class="font49" style="font-style:italic;">in Sky &amp; Telescope</span><span class="font49"> magazine for so many years. I will never forget the times&nbsp;we spent by the campfire at the annual Stellafane Convention on Breezy&nbsp;Hill in Vermont, or in chaise longues at the Winter Star Party in the Florida&nbsp;Keys, just gazing at the stars and musing on the limits ofvision.</span></p>
<p class="font49">I am honored to recognize George Phillips Bond (1825-1865), second director of Harvard College Observatory, whose dedication to&nbsp;unlocking (he visual mysteries of the Orion Nebula with the Harvard&nbsp;Observatory's 15-inch refractor led ultimately to his premature death.&nbsp;Reading his diaries<span class="font30">(</span><span class="font49">wo decades ago kept me enchanted on many a cloudy&nbsp;night, and taught me how to be a patient and persistent observer.</span></p>
<p class="font49">A deep bow to &quot;envelope pushers&quot; Barbara Wilson and Larry Mitchell, who roped and tied this wild planetary observer at the Texas Star&nbsp;Party and force-fed me deep-deep-deep-sky objects until I became a&nbsp;convert - thank you (I think)! Assisting them was a phalanx of galaxy&nbsp;hunters, including David Eicher, Tippy and Patty D'Auria, and Jack&nbsp;Newton. Brian Skiff introduced me to many visual challenges, including&nbsp;seeing faint globular clusters with the naked eye. Peter Collins first introduced me to (he more challenging Messier objects. David Levy was always&nbsp;around to say, &quot;No, Steve, that's a galaxy not a comet.&quot; And at several star&nbsp;parties.

<p class="font49">And no words can express the love and devotion I have for my wife, Donna, who, despite having been &quot;husbandless&quot; for a year, found solace&nbsp;in exploring erupting volcanoes, practicing her &quot;free dives&quot; to unknown&nbsp;depths, and peering inquisitively into the eyes of the night.</p>
<p class="font49">Finally, I would like to thank our &quot;children,&quot; Pele-Hiiaka of Volcano, Milky Way, and Miranda-Pywacket for keeping their digits off the keyboard when I wasnl looking. Alas, I cannot blame them if any errors have&nbsp;sneaked unannounced into this book; I take full responsibility.</p>
