<p><span class="font43" style="font-weight:bold;">Objects Messier could not find</span></p>
<p class="font49">At the end of his catalogue in the <span class="font49" style="font-style:italic;">Connaissance des Temps</span><span class="font49"> for 1784, Messier included a list of objects reported by other astronomers that he&nbsp;had been unsuccessful in locating himself. The list, translated from&nbsp;French by Storm Dunlop, follows. As was his custom, Messier refers to&nbsp;himself in the third person.</span></p>
<p class="font49">Nebulae discovered by various astronomers, which M. Messier has searched for in vain.</p>
<p class="font49">Hevelius, in his <span class="font49" style="font-style:italic;">Prodrome Astronom ie,</span><span class="font49"> gives the pos </span><span class="font28">让 </span><span class="font49">ion of a nebula located at the very top of the head of Hercules at right ascension&nbsp;252° 24<sup>r</sup> 3&quot;, and northern declination 13° 18' 37&quot;.</span></p>
<p class="font49">On 20 June 1764, under good skies, M. Messier searched for this nebula, but was unable (o find it.</p>
<p class="font49">In the same work, Hevelius gives the positions of four nebulae, one in the forehead of Capricornus, the second preceding the eye,&nbsp;the third following the second, and the fourth above the latter and&nbsp;reaching the eye of Capricornus. M. de Mauperiuis gave the&nbsp;position of these four nebulae in his work <span class="font49" style="font-style:italic;">Figure of the Stars,</span><span class="font49"> second&nbsp;edition, page 109. M. Derham also mentions them in his paper&nbsp;published in </span><span class="font49" style="font-style:italic;">Philosophical Transactions,</span><span class="font49"> no. 42&amp; page 70. These&nbsp;nebulae are also found on several planispheres and celestial globes.</span></p>
<p class="font49">M. Messier searched for these four nebulae: namely on 27 July and 3 August, and 17 and 18 October 1764, without being able to&nbsp;find them, and he doubts that they exist.</p>
<p class="font49">In the same work, Hevelius gives the position of two other nebulae, one this side of the star that is above the tail of Cygnus, and&nbsp;the other beyond the same star.</p>
<p class="font49">On 24 and 28 October 1764, M. Messier carefully searched for these two nebulae, without being able to find them. M. Messier did&nbsp;indeed observe, at the tip of the tail of Cygnus, near the star e a&nbsp;cluster of faint stars, but its position was different from the one&nbsp;reported by Hevelius in his work.</p>
<p class="font49">Hevelius also reports, in the same work, the position of a nebula in the ear of Pegasus.</p>
<p class="font49">M. Messier looked for it under good conditions during the night of 24 to 25 October 1764, without being able to discover it. unless it&nbsp;is the nebula that M. Messier observed between the head of Pegasus&nbsp;and that of Equuleus. See number 15 in the current catalogue.</p>
<p class="font49">M. 1'abbO de la Caille, in a paper on the nebulae in the southern sky, published in the Academy volume of 1755, page 194, gives the&nbsp;position of a nebula that resembles, he says, the nucleus of a small&nbsp;comet. Its right ascension on 1 January 1752 is 18° 13* 41&quot; and its&nbsp;declination is-33<span class="font28">。</span><span class="font49">37'5&quot;.</span></p>
<p class="font49">On 27 July 1764, under an absolutely clear sky, M. Messier searched for this nebula without success. It may be that the&nbsp;instrument that M. Messier was using was not adequate to show it.&nbsp;Subsequently seen by M. Messier. See number 69.</p>
<p class="font49">M. de Cassini describes in his <span class="font49" style="font-style:italic;">Elements of Astronomy,</span><span class="font49"> page 79, how his father discovered a nebula in the space between Canis&nbsp;Major and Canis Minor, which was one of the finest that could be&nbsp;seen through a telescope.</span></p>
<p class="font49">M. Messier has looked for this nebula on several occasions,</p>
<p class="font49">under clear skies, without being able to find it, and he assumes that it may have been a comet that had either just appeared, or was in&nbsp;the process of fading. Nothing is so like a nebula as a comet that is&nbsp;just beginning to be visible to instruments.</p><img src="Deep-sky companions the Messier objects by Stephen James OMeara (z-lib_files/Deep-sky companions the Messier objects by Stephen James OMeara (z-lib-287.png" style="width:230pt;height:32pt;"/>
<p class="font49">M. Messier searched for this on21 October 1780, using his achromatic telescope, without being able to find it.</p>
<p><span class="font43" style="font-weight:bold;">Messier marathons</span></p>
<p class="font49">Each spring amateur astronomers around the world run a marathon <span class="font28">一 </span><span class="font49">not the grueling 26-mile-long race, but a visual race through the night sky to&nbsp;glimpse all 109 Messier objects in a single night. Messier marathons, as&nbsp;they are called, are held during late March and early April, the only time of&nbsp;the year when all the Messier objects are visible between dusk and dawn,&nbsp;and the only time of year when the sun lies in a region of sky devoid of&nbsp;these celestial treasures. On the first clear, moonless night, marathoners&nbsp;start searching low in the western sky at dusk, then hop from one M object&nbsp;to the next, until they've exhausted all the objects (or themselves) by&nbsp;dawn. Aside from clear skies, success requires a decent knowledge of the&nbsp;stars and constellations, efficient use of a telescope, and the ability to read&nbsp;star charts and confirm the appearance and position of each Messier&nbsp;object. These skills prove critical especially during twilight hours, when&nbsp;inevitably some targets must be found.</span></p>
<p class="font49">To the best of my knowledge the Messier marathon originated in Spain when a group of amateur astronomers set out to attempt the task&nbsp;in the 1960s. Several amateur astronomers across the globe indepen<span class="font30">・</span><span class="font49">&nbsp;dently conceived the notion a decade later. In the March 1979 issue of&nbsp;</span><span class="font49" style="font-style:italic;">Sky &amp; Telescope</span><span class="font49"> magazine, the late Deep-Sky Wonders columnist Walter&nbsp;Scott Houston described how, in the United States, lom Hoffelder of&nbsp;Florida began marathoning with amateurs in the inid</span><span class="font30">・</span><span class="font49">l 970s, while the&nbsp;Amateur Astronomers of Pittsburgh independently started the activity&nbsp;in 1977. On the West Coast, Donald Machholz, a leading comet discov</span><span class="font30">・</span><span class="font49">&nbsp;erer, dreamed up the marathon idea in September 1978. Needless to&nbsp;say, serendipity struck like wildfire, and the activity spread worldwide.&nbsp;Today astronomy clubs routinely sponsor Messier marathons, as well as&nbsp;variations on the theme, such as binocular marathons, CCD-imaging&nbsp;competitions, and CCD vs. visual showdowns. One club even puts on a&nbsp;Messier event in which amateur astronomers compete in a cycling&nbsp;race, stopping occasionally to hunt down M objects with portable tele</span><span class="font30">・</span><span class="font49">&nbsp;scopes!</span></p>
<p class="font49">Messier marathons are popular for several reasons. Besides being fun and challenging, they provide astronomy clubs with an annual activ<span class="font30">・</span><span class="font49">&nbsp;ity for their members, and they provide a &quot;proving ground<sup>0</sup> for testing&nbsp;your observing techniques and search methods. And, let's face it, successful completion of a Messier marathon, just like the running race, earns&nbsp;you<sup>H</sup>bragging rights” </span><span class="font28">一 </span><span class="font49">and possibly a T-shirt or lapel pin. But also, participants often come away from the mad dash around the heavens having</span></p>
<p class="font49">learned something useful, whether it be about the sky, their telescope, or themselves.</p>
<p class="font49">Which brings me to why 1 have never participated in a Messier marathon. It*s not that there is anything wrong with the activity-as I have&nbsp;mentioned, it sounds like a lot of fun, especially if done with friends. But,&nbsp;as you have seen in this book, I much prefer to dote on objects, often&nbsp;spending hours at a time studying a single one - which would put me at a&nbsp;definite disadvantage in a race! To me it is a philosophical thing, and&nbsp;maybe I'm just a hopeless romantic. But dashing around the sky simply to&nbsp;tally how many of these extraordinary cosmic marvels you can spot in a&nbsp;night is tantamount to sprinting through the halls and galleries of the&nbsp;Louvre just to say you've seen all its famous masterpieces.</p>
<p class="font49">But if you are so inclined, and are interested in learning more about Messier marathons, I encourage you to contact your local planetarium or&nbsp;astronomy club, many of which sponsor such events. Ybu might also get a&nbsp;copy of the book by Don Machholz titled <span class="font49" style="font-style:italic;">Messier Marathon Observer's&nbsp;Guide: Handbook and Atlas,</span><span class="font49"> which offers suggestions on how to prepare&nbsp;for and conduct a marathon, and contains other useful information.</span></p>
<p class="font49">If you would prefer to take your time logging observations of the Messier objects, but would like to receive recognition for your efforts,&nbsp;organizations such as the Astronomical League (Contact: Berton Stevens,&nbsp;2112 Kingfisher Lane E., Rolling Meadows, IL 60008) and the Royal&nbsp;Astronomical Society of Canada (Contact: National Office, 136 Dupont St.,&nbsp;Toronto, ON M5R 1V2, Canada) have Messier &quot;clubs&quot; you can join.&nbsp;Members are awarded certificates upon completion of the Messier list,&nbsp;and there are lists and awards for both binocular and telescope users.</p>
<p class="font49">In addition to hosting Messier marathons, astronomy clubs should also consider using March and the Messier objects to launch larger programs designed to educate the public about astronomy. By celebrating a&nbsp;Messier Month, clubs could bring the magic of Messier and his catalogue&nbsp;to schoolchildren and the greater public through slide shows and special&nbsp;observing events. The idea, of course, would be to showcase the Messier&nbsp;objects with the simple message that the splendors of the universe are&nbsp;readily accessible to anyone who enjoys gazing into the night sky -whether it's with the naked eye, binoculars, or a telescope. Messier-specific activities could run in conjunction with Astronomy Day celebrations,&nbsp;which are held around the same time of year. And there are ample products to distribute or display to inspire the public about these deep-sky&nbsp;splendors, one being the fine Messier Objects poster produced by Sky&nbsp;Publishing Corp., which displays photographs of all the M objects and&nbsp;lists their locations, magnitudes, and other data. As part of any Messier&nbsp;celebration, special training sessions could be held, in which skilled&nbsp;observers not participating in a marathon would help beginners to locate&nbsp;M objects.</p>
<p><span class="font43" style="font-weight:bold;">A quick guide to navigating the Coma-Virgo cluster</span></p><div>
<p class="font49">Probing the depths of the Coma-Virgo Cluster may seem like a daunting task. Just look at all of those tiny galaxy symbols jammed together near the&nbsp;center of the wide-field map at the back of this book. But don't let the&nbsp;clutter discourage you. The cluster is actually quite easy to navigate. The&nbsp;simplest approach is to start with M58, one of the brightest members of&nbsp;the Virgo Cluster.</p>
<p class="font49">First locate the 3rd-magnitude star Epsilon (e) Virginis. Five degrees to its west is 5th-magnitude Rho (p) Virginis; Rho is easy to confirm in&nbsp;binoculars, because it is the brightest star in the middle of an arc of three&nbsp;stars oriented north-south. Two degrees west of Rho you will find the star&nbsp;20 Virginis. M58 forms the northern apex of an equilateral triangle with&nbsp;Rho and 20 Virginis. M58 is easy to confirm because it is only 7' to the west&nbsp;of an 8th-magnitude star.</p>
<p class="font49">M58 is a member of what I call the “Great Wall of Galaxies** - a strong line of six Messier galaxies, oriented slightly northwest 10 southeast, that&nbsp;spans 5° of sky. Pairs of galaxies punctuate either end of the Wall, making&nbsp;identification of these objects easy. Using M58 as your reference point,&nbsp;move about 1 to the east and slightly south, where you will find your first&nbsp;pairing, M59 and M60, separated by only 30<sup>z</sup>. M60, which is the brightest&nbsp;galaxy in this string, has a very faint companion, NGC 4647, to the north.</p>
<p class="font49">Now return to M58 and continue that line an equal distance to the northwest; there you will come upon the bright, round galaxy M87. One degree farther is the other galaxy pairing, M84 and M86.</p>
<p class="font49">The Great Wall also forms the baseline of a coathanger asterism of galaxies, which includes M8&amp; M89, M90, and M91. On the chart, notice&nbsp;that M90 forms the northern apex of an equilateral triangle with our reference galaxy, M5&amp; and M87. Furthermore, M89 is near the center of that&nbsp;triangle. However, because M90 is the more obvious of the two, try for it&nbsp;first. Not only is it bright, but it is an oblique spiral galaxy and clearly looks&nbsp;different from the other, more elliptical, hazes.</p>
<p class="font49">To find M88, simply move the telescope 1 to the northeast of M90. M88 is easy to identify, because it is another fine spiral and there is an&nbsp;obvious double star at its southeastern tip.</p>
<p class="font49">M91 lies less than 1° due east of M88. But be careful here not to mistake M91 forNGC 4571 just to its southeast. Because there are no other&nbsp;galaxies in this immediate region, you can identify M91 by moving the&nbsp;telescope to the southeast to pick up NGC4571 (or vice versa).</p>
<p class="font49">The final three galaxies <span class="font28">一 </span><span class="font49">M9&amp; M99, and M100 - should present no problems, because they reside near three binocular stars, the brightest of&nbsp;which is 6 Coma Berenices. All you have to do is locate those stars with&nbsp;your binoculars, point your telescope to them, and you're home free. See&nbsp;how simple it can be?</span></p>
