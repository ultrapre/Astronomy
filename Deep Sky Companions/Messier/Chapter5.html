<p><span class="font43" style="font-weight:bold;">5 Some thoughts on Charles&nbsp;Messier</span></p></li></ul>
<p class="font49">Charles Messier is best remembered for the objects he largely tried to avoid, and help others to avoid. Messier was first and foremost a comet&nbsp;hunter, and he dedicated clear, moonless nights to this pursuit. He was&nbsp;quite successful in his search, having found some 15 comets, though only&nbsp;12 bear his name (with some exceptions, comet names were not officially&nbsp;used until the twentieth century). In his time, comet hunting was&nbsp;intensely competitive, and Messier was inspired not only by the search&nbsp;but also by the fame new comet discoveries would bring him. The fuzzy,&nbsp;no/zcometary objects he encountered intrigued him, in part, because they&nbsp;fooled him, if only briefly. Messier created his renowned catalogue largely&nbsp;to benefit <span class="font49" style="font-style:italic;">comet hunters,</span><span class="font49"> so they would not confuse these nebulous glows&nbsp;with comets. But it's also possible Messier knew he would reap fame by&nbsp;discovering new nebulae.</span></p>
<p class="font49">Messiefs first list of 45 objects, published in the <span class="font49" style="font-style:italic;">Memoirs</span><span class="font49"> of the French Academy of Sciences for the year 1771, was well received by his&nbsp;friends and colleagues. In the introduction to the work, astronomer&nbsp;Jerome de Lalande praised Messier, saying the task could only have been&nbsp;undertaken by an indefatigable and experienced observer. William&nbsp;Herschel, in particular, regarded Messier's catalogue as an excellent collection of clusters and nebulae, and it apparently prompted Herschel to&nbsp;undertake his own search for similar deep-sky objects. (Herschel&nbsp;employed much larger telescopes in his survey which led to the additional discovery of more than 2,000 objects.) Nevertheless, legitimate&nbsp;questions can be raised about why certain objects made it into Messier's&nbsp;catalogue and other seemingly obvious ones did not.</span></p>
<p class="font49">Messier was surprised to resolve stars in several objects described by lheir discoverers as nebulous patches. But if his aim was to help comet&nbsp;hunters avoid objects that might prove confusing, why would he include&nbsp;<span class="font49" style="font-style:italic;">obvious</span><span class="font49"> open clusters, such as M23, M34, M45, and M47? Perhaps,&nbsp;because they appear fuzzy to the naked eye, he did so for the benefit of the&nbsp;naked-eye gazer. (It should be noted that in the mid-1700s spotting a new&nbsp;comet with the unaided eye was not uncommon.)</span></p>
<p class="font49">It would be fruitless to question the observing ability of the man described by King Louis XV as the &quot;ferret of comets/' Messier was highly&nbsp;respected for his keen eye and attention to detail. His expertise was not&nbsp;limited to the visual search for comets, as he was an equally skilled&nbsp;observer of, among other things, the planets, stellar occultations, and&nbsp;sunspots. Still, one has to wonder how Messier could have <span class="font49" style="font-style:italic;">missed</span><span class="font49"> so many&nbsp;relatively bright nebulous objects during his comet hunts. Anyone who&nbsp;takes the time to sweep the sky with a telescope around (he famed M&nbsp;objects cannot help but chance upon some nebulae and clusters that&nbsp;were not included in his catalogue, apparently escaping his gaze. But did&nbsp;they?</span></p>
<p class="font49">We know that of the 109 objects in the catalogue, Messier actually discovered 41 of them; the other objects had been found by others, but&nbsp;Messier recorded their pos<span class="font28">让</span><span class="font49">ions and appearance anyway since they could&nbsp;be confused with comets. Once he started the catalogue, Messier wrote,&nbsp;he endeavored to find other nebulosities; he made this something of a&nbsp;project for its own sake, at least in the beginning. But after the first catalogue of 45 objects was published, most of the objects recorded thereafter&nbsp;by Messier were found serendipitously, when particular comets he was&nbsp;following would happen to pass near a nebulous patch. On average, he&nbsp;discovered only about two new catalogue objects per year.</span></p>
<p class="font49">One particularly puzzling omission from the catalogue is the Double Cluster in Perseus. Why would Messier not include this conspicuous Milky&nbsp;Way object, which appears distinctly cometlike to the naked eye? Yes, the&nbsp;cluster does resolve with the slightest optical aid into a myriad of individual stars, but the same could be said of the Pleiades, the brilliant and easily&nbsp;resolvable open cluster in Taurus, which he catalogued as his 45th entry.&nbsp;His inclusion of the Pleiades makes it hard to argue that he considered&nbsp;some objects too obviously <span class="font49" style="font-style:italic;">not</span><span class="font49"> cometlike in appearance to be confused&nbsp;by them, or to bother recording them.</span></p>
<p class="font49">One can only speculate about the absence of the Double Cluster and other bright objects of which we presume Messier should have taken&nbsp;notice, even with his rudimentary scopes. And one can perhaps detect a&nbsp;bit of defensiveness in Messier about his catalogue in some remarks he&nbsp;made in the French almanac <span class="font49" style="font-style:italic;">Connaissance des Temps</span><span class="font49"> for 1801, just a few&nbsp;years before his death. After me, the celebrated Herschel published a catalogue of 2,000 which he has observed. This unveiling of the sky, made&nbsp;with instruments of great aperture, does not help in a perusal of the sky for&nbsp;faint comets. Thus my object[ive] is different from his, as I only need&nbsp;nebulae visible in a telescope of two feet [length]. Since the publication of&nbsp;my catalogue I have observed still others; 1 will publish them in the future&nbsp;... for the purpose of making them more easy to recognize, and for those&nbsp;searching for comets to remain in less uncertainty.&quot; It would be informative to know Messier's feelings on this 30 years earlier. In </span><span class="font49" style="font-style:italic;">Messiers Nebulae&nbsp;and Star Clusters</span><span class="font49"> Jones comments that the argument that large apertures&nbsp;do not help in the discovery of comets doesn't hold water. But I find&nbsp;Messier's remark about his objective being different from Herschel's, and&nbsp;his need to see only nebulae visible in a telescope of two</span><span class="font30">・</span><span class="font49">foot length, as&nbsp;testimony to what I believe was his unwavering purpose, the pursuit of&nbsp;comets.</span></p>
<p class="font49">It is also surprising that Messier could not telescopically resolve the great globular clusters M5 in Serpens Caput and M13 in Hercules. Of course, he&nbsp;was limited not only by the poor location of his observatory but also by the&nbsp;poor quality of the optics in his instruments. He used about a dozen different telescopes ranging from reflectors with inefficient speculum mirrors&nbsp;(the largest having an 8-inch aperture) to simple refractors with apertures&nbsp;of up to 3% inches. He generally employed magnifications of between 60 x&nbsp;and 138x. Compared to todays instruments, all these telescopes were of&nbsp;substandard optical quality &quot;It is a pity/' wrote Smyth in his <span class="font49" style="font-style:italic;">Cycle of&nbsp;Celestial Objects,</span><span class="font49"> &quot;that this active and assiduous astronomer could not&nbsp;have been furnished with one ofthe giant telescopes of the present day....&nbsp;One is only surprised that with his methods and means, so much was&nbsp;accomplished/' Likewise, Lalande could only lament that the precise and&nbsp;zealous Messier could not live under purer and less cloudy skies, which&nbsp;obviously hampered his abil</span><span class="font28">让</span><span class="font49">y to find new comets and nebulae.</span></p>
<p class="font49">Some of today's skilled comet hunters claim to have an innate sense of what a new comet will look like through the telescope. Thus, it is the&nbsp;comet huntefs prerogative to skip over or ignore whatever object he or&nbsp;she deems not cometary. It is reasonable to presume that Messier had his&nbsp;own criteria for judging whether an object was sufficiently cometlike in&nbsp;appearance to warrant noting its position* though he did not relate those&nbsp;criteria. But it should be said that he never endeavored to conduct a comprehensive visual search for noncometary nebulae. An old Chinese&nbsp;proverb tells us that obstacles are what we see when we take our mind off&nbsp;the goal. And Messiefs goal was to discover comets, not nebulae or star&nbsp;clusters. In contrast, Herschel's goal <span class="font49" style="font-style:italic;">was</span><span class="font49"> to systematically survey the&nbsp;entire sky for deep-sky bounty beyond the limits of Messier's instruments.&nbsp;Most of the relatively bright non-Messier objects we enjoy today (at least&nbsp;from the Northern Hemisphere) were discovered by Herschel. There can&nbsp;be no doubt that had Messier conducted a similar deliberate search for&nbsp;noncometary objects, his catalogue would have turned out vastly larger&nbsp;and less haphazard than it is. But that was not Messier's concern, comets&nbsp;were. It is only by the fickleness of fate that none of his comets had the&nbsp;staying power of his catalogue of deep-sky wonders.</span></p>
