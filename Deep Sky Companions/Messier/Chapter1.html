<p><span class="font43" style="font-weight:bold;">1 Charles Messier and his catalogue</span></p></li></ul>
<p class="font49">In 1744 a brilliant comet punctuated the night sky, attracting the eyes of people around the world and capturing the imagination of a 14-year-old&nbsp;named Charles Messier. Seven years later the young man moved from his&nbsp;native Lorraine, a region of southern France, to Paris to find his fortune,&nbsp;which he felt was out among the stars. The key to his success, he would&nbsp;soon discover, was in hunting for comets.</p>
<p class="font49">IfMessiefs competitive spirit was anything like that of today's comet hunters, there is a good chance that it was born out of failure, not success.&nbsp;In 1758 many people were rushing to find the comet whose return&nbsp;Edmond Halley had predicted years earlier, and the keen-eyed Messier&nbsp;had a good chance to be the first. Al the time, he was clerk at the Marine&nbsp;Observatory, which the astronomer Joseph Nicolas Delisle had established a decade earlier at the Hotel de Cluny in Paris. Delisle, who was&nbsp;nearing 70, had taken Messier under his wing in 1751 and had begun to&nbsp;shape his career. By 1754 Messier had become a highly skilled and&nbsp;respected observer. And his main pursuit was hunting for comets.</p>
<p class="font49">The aged Delisle had great hopes that his young protege would be the first to sight Halleys Comet. Thus, Delisle had prepared a star chart&nbsp;with two plots of the comet (whose position he had calculated), and&nbsp;instructed Messier to conduct a search of these areas. Messier began his&nbsp;search in mid-1757; it ended successfully on 21 January 1759, though the&nbsp;effort took much longer than he had hoped. He explained in the&nbsp;<span class="font49" style="font-style:italic;">Connaissancedes letups</span><span class="font49"> for 1810:</span></p><div>

<p class="font49">ovals drawn |by Delisle) on the celestial chart which was my guide. At about six o'clock I discovered a faint glow resembling that of the&nbsp;cornet I had observed in the previous year: it was the Comet itself,</p>
<p class="font49">There is cause to presume that if M. Delisle had not made the limits of the two ovals so restricted, 1 would have discovered the</p>
<p class="font49">comet much earlier.</p>
<p class="font49">But Messier had been beaten. Johann Georg Palitzsch, a German farmer and amateur astronomer who lived near Dresden, sighted Halley's prodi-<span class="font28">劇 </span><span class="font49">comet on Christmas night 1758 -a month before Messier did. The&nbsp;news of Palitzsch<sup>r</sup>s find, however, did not reach Paris for several months,&nbsp;<sup>so</sup> Messier was unaware that he had been “scooped.&quot; In fact, Messier</span></p><div><img src="Deep-sky companions the Messier objects by Stephen James OMeara (z-lib_files/Deep-sky companions the Messier objects by Stephen James OMeara (z-lib-7.png" style="width:168pt;height:12pt;"/></div><br clear="all"><img src="Deep-sky companions the Messier objects by Stephen James OMeara (z-lib_files/Deep-sky companions the Messier objects by Stephen James OMeara (z-lib-8.jpg" style="width:243pt;height:319pt;"/>
<p class="font55">CHARIzO <span class="font58" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Mes</span></p>
<p><span class="font48" style="font-weight:bold;">Portrait of Charles Messier (June 26,1730-April 12,1817) in 1801, twenty years after his last catalogue observation on April 13, </span><span class="font48" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">\7^\. Bulletin</span><span class="font48" style="font-weight:bold;"> de la Societe&nbsp;Astronomique de France, 1929.</span></p>
<p class="font49">deemed his find one ofthe most important astronomical discoveries ever, for it showed (hat comets could orbit the sun and return again. Messier&nbsp;immediately informed Delisle, who confirmed the observation but told&nbsp;Messier not to announce it under any circumstances, for reasons that are&nbsp;unclear. Messier did not complain, at least publicly, about this strange&nbsp;tions.</p><div>
<p class="font49">embargo on his &quot;discovery.<sup>1</sup>* Only when Messier sighted the comet again after it had rounded the sun did Delisle allow him to publish his observa</p></div><br clear="all">
<p class="font49">“Such a discreditable and selfish concealment of an interesting discovery<span class="font30">；</span><span class="font49">* wrote J. Russell Hind a century later, “is not likely to sully again the annals of astronomy. Some members of the French Academy looked&nbsp;upon Messiefs observations, when published, as forgeries, but his name&nbsp;stood too high for such imputations to last long, and the positions were&nbsp;soon received as authentic, and have been of great service in correcting&nbsp;the orbit of the comet at this (1835) return.<sup>0</sup></span></p>
<p class="font49">Furthermore, Halley's 1758 return was not announced until 1 April 1759, three months after the first sighting and three weeks after the comet&nbsp;had rounded the sun. Ironically, the only vital positional observations of&nbsp;the comet that winter were Messiefs. By this time. Messier had heard of&nbsp;Palitzsch's earlier sighting. Messier's disappointment possibly had something to do with his decision to start a systematic search for comets.</p>
<p class="font49">COMET MASQUERADERS</p>
<p class="font49">In conducting his searches, Messier did not have the benefit of good star charts like we have today, showing the positions of galaxies, star clusters,&nbsp;and nebulae - what the great twentieth-century comet hunter Leslie&nbsp;Peltier termed &quot;comet masqueraders? In Messier's day, these objects were&nbsp;largely unknown and uncharted. Thus, he must have been surprised&nbsp;when, on 28 August 1758, while tracking a comet, he came across a fuzzy&nbsp;patch near the star Zeta ([) Tauri. At first he thought he'd snared a new&nbsp;comet. But the fuzzy patch never moved with respect to the stars, as&nbsp;comets always do. Realizing he had been fooled by the sky's version of a&nbsp;practical joke, Messier began to build a catalogue of what he called these&nbsp;&quot;embarrassing objects.<sup>11</sup></p>
<p class="font49">Thai first entry in his catalogue, Messier 1, is now commonly called the Crab Nebula. Although Messier never realized it. his first object was&nbsp;probably the most interesting thing ever to cast light into his telescope. It&nbsp;is all that remains of a supernova that was observed in 1054, which shined&nbsp;as brightly as Venus.</p>
<p class="font49">By 1765, Messier had compiled a list of 41 such objects. Of those, only 17 or 18 were his own discoveries; the rest had been seen previously&nbsp;by others (whom he acknowledged). Before submitting the list for publi-cation, he decided to round it out with a few more objects. So on 4 March</p><div><img src="Deep-sky companions the Messier objects by Stephen James OMeara (z-lib_files/Deep-sky companions the Messier objects by Stephen James OMeara (z-lib-9.png" style="width:168pt;height:12pt;"/></div><br clear="all"><div>
<p class="font49">of (hai year he determined the positions of the Great Nebula in Orion <span class="font30">(</span><span class="font49">M42 and M43), the Beehive Cluster (M44) in Cancer, and the Pleiades&nbsp;</span><span class="font30">(</span><span class="font49">M45</span><span class="font30">)</span><span class="font49">in Taurus. He presented his list of 45 nebulae and star clusters to the&nbsp;Academy of Sciences in Paris in February 1771, and it appeared in the&nbsp;Academy's </span><span class="font49" style="font-style:italic;">Memoirs</span><span class="font49"> for that year, which were actually published in 1774.&nbsp;Now with eight comet discoveries and a fresh appointment as Astronomer&nbsp;<sub>t0 t</sub>|<sub>ie</sub> Navy. Messiers career was rocketing. Indeed, within days after sub-mining his list of objects for publication, he had already discovered four&nbsp;more star clusters, and by April 1780 the list had grown to 68 objects. Of&nbsp;</span><span class="font28">【</span><span class="font49">he 23 new objects </span><span class="font31" style="font-style:italic;">一</span><span class="font49"> most of which he found while observing comets -some had been recorded previously by Messier's contemporaries, includ-ing his younger colleague Pierre MOchain (who discovered 32 new nebulous objects between 1780 and 1781), the Italian observer Barnabus&nbsp;Oriani, and the French astronomer Nicolas Louis de Lacaille. This&nbsp;updated catalogue was published in the French almanac </span><span class="font49" style="font-style:italic;">Connaissance&nbsp;des Temps</span><span class="font49"> for the year 1783.</span></p>
<p class="font49">On 13 April 1781, less than a month after William Herschefs discovery of the distant planet Uranus, Messier observed the 100th cometlike object<span class="font30">(</span><span class="font49">o be logged in his catalogue. Although he had intended that object&nbsp;to be the last one, he decided at the last minute to include three additional&nbsp;objects observed by Mechain, but which Messier did not have time&nbsp;(before the publication deadline) to observe himself. Thus, Messier's final&nbsp;catalogue described 103 objects and was published in the </span><span class="font49" style="font-style:italic;">Connaissance&nbsp;des Temps</span><span class="font49"> for 1784.</span></p>
<p class="font49">In 1921 a French popularizer of astronomy, Camille Flammarion, found notes about an additional object in Messier's personal copy of the&nbsp;catalogue. The object (NGC 4594, the Sombrero Galaxy), in Virgo, was designated M104. In 1947 Canadian astronomer Helen Sawyer Hogg proposed adding four more objects discovered by MGchain to the catalogue.&nbsp;Mechain had described them in a letter to a German astronomy journal,&nbsp;and notations in Messier's copy of the printed catalogue suggest that he&nbsp;was aware of them. One of the objects was M104, so Hogg labeled the&nbsp;remaining three Ml05, Ml06, and Ml07. Subsequently, Owen Gingerich,&nbsp;astronomical historian at Harvard University, recommended the inclu-sion of two more galaxies, NGC 3556 and NGC 3992 in Ursa Major,&nbsp;because they too were mentioned in Messier's original catalogue; they&nbsp;became M108 and M109, respectively. Ml 10 is the most recent, and presumably the Iasi, addition to the collection. Its inclusion was suggested in&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>966 by the late Kenneth Glyn Jones, who noted an engraving and descrip-tions by Messier of the Andromeda Galaxy (M31) and its two companions&nbsp;<span class="font28">〔</span><span class="font49">hai had been published by Messier in 1807. One of the companions had&nbsp;<sup>been</sup> included in the original catalogue, as M32, but the other (NGC 205)&nbsp;:ad not, so it became M110. Indeed, Messier had first seen it on 10 August</span></p><img src="Deep-sky companions the Messier objects by Stephen James OMeara (z-lib_files/Deep-sky companions the Messier objects by Stephen James OMeara (z-lib-12.jpg" style="width:349pt;height:441pt;"/>
<p><span class="font48" style="font-weight:bold;">Messier.</span></p>
<p class="font49">MYSTERIOUS AND “MISSING&quot; MESSIER OBJECTS</p>
<p class="font49">Six objects in the Messier catalogue are particularly curious. M40 is simply two faint stars. Messier detected it while searching for a nebula described</p><div>
<p class="font49">by the seventeenth-century observer Johann Hevelius. <sup>4,</sup>We presume,&quot; <sub>wro</sub>te Messier, &quot;that Hevelius mistook these two stars for a nebula.&quot;</p></div><br clear="all">
<p class="font49">Regardless, Messier included them in his catalogue. Similarly, M73 is a small group of a few faint stars, which he thought was nebulous at first&nbsp;glance. The cases of four &quot;missing&quot; Messier objects - 47, 48,91, and 102 -<sub>are</sub> different. No nebula or cluster resides at or near the positions recorded&nbsp;for them by Messier. The mysteries have been explained in different ways.&nbsp;In 1934 Oswald Thomas, in his book <span class="font49" style="font-style:italic;">Astronomie,</span><span class="font49"> suggested that Messier&nbsp;47 was actually NGC 2422, a bright open cluster in Puppis. Dr. T. E Morris,&nbsp;a long-time member of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada's&nbsp;Montreal Centre, independently arrived at the same conclusion in 1959,&nbsp;suggesting that Messier may have made a simple mistake in computing&nbsp;the objects position. Morris discovered that by reversing Messier's directions both in right ascension and in declination from the star 2 Puppis (the&nbsp;star Messier used for reference), one arrives at NGC 2422.</span></p>
<p class="font49">Gingerich believes the object that Messier listed as number 48 is probably the cluster NGC 2548, which lies about 5° south of the position&nbsp;that Messier documented, a conclusion reached independently by Morris&nbsp;and others. NGC 2548 has the same right ascension that Messier recorded,&nbsp;making it likely that he unwittingly used the wrong reference star when&nbsp;determining the object's declination.</p>
<p class="font49">The tnie identity of Messier 91 is the most perplexing, because, as Jones comments, the problem lies not in the lack of candidates but in the&nbsp;wealth of them. M9J is in the Coma-Virgo Cloud of galaxies, the densest&nbsp;region of galaxies visible in small telescopes. Some observers believe that&nbsp;<span class="font49" style="font-style:italic;">NGC</span><span class="font49"> 4571, a 12th</span><span class="font30">・</span><span class="font49">magnitude galaxy slightly northwest of the position&nbsp;Messier recorded, is M91. Others argue that this particular galaxy would&nbsp;have been too faint for Messier to see. Gingerich, on the other hand,&nbsp;believes that M91 is nothing more than a duplicate observation of M58,&nbsp;which has a similar right ascension but is off in declination by 2%°. Most&nbsp;observers, however, have come to accept a new theory. In 1969, Z C.&nbsp;Williams, a Texas amateur astronomer, proposed that Messier had originally offset the coordinates ofM91 using M89 as a reference point but that&nbsp;when he plotted the object, he mistakenly chose M58 as the reference&nbsp;point. that is what happened, then NGC 4548, a barred spiral galaxy, is&nbsp;Messier 91.</span></p>
<p class="font49">Finally, Messier 102, which Mechain first observed and whose posi-(ion Messier did not check, is generally believed to be a case of mistaken identity. According to Hogg, Mechain discovered that the object desig-nated as M102 was a duplicate observation of M101, and explained the&nbsp;error in a letter published in the 1786 <span class="font49" style="font-style:italic;">Berliner Astronomisches Jahrbtich,&nbsp;</span><span class="font49">which contained a copy of Messier's supplement. An English translation&nbsp;of the relevant paragraph of that letter reads:</span></p>
<p class="font49">On page 267 of the <span class="font49" style="font-style:italic;">Connaissance des Temps</span><span class="font49"> for 1784 M. Messier lists under No. 102 a nebula which I have discovered between omicron&nbsp;</span><span class="font49" style="font-style:italic;">Bootis</span><span class="font49"> and iota </span><span class="font49" style="font-style:italic;">Draconis:</span><span class="font49"> this is nothing but an error. This nebula is&nbsp;the same as the preceding No. 101. In the list of my nebulous stars&nbsp;communicated to him M. Messier was confused due to an error in&nbsp;the sky-chart.</span></p>
<p class="font49">&quot;The real puzzle,&quot; notes Gingerich in <span class="font49" style="font-style:italic;">The Messier Album,</span><span class="font49"> °is why this letter was overlooked by so many astronomers for so long/* Not until Hogg published it in the </span><span class="font49" style="font-style:italic;">Journal</span><span class="font49"> of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada in&nbsp;1947 was the confusion regarding M102 finally cleared up.</span></p>
<p class="font49">Messier's long career began to wane when he suffered a stroke in 1815, which left him partially paralyzed. T\vo years later he died at age 87.&nbsp;He left a wonderful legacy, not of comets, but of magnificent deep-sky&nbsp;objects that he sought to avoid -109 lavish monuments to the skill of one&nbsp;of the most perceptive and enthusiastic observers of the night sky.</p>
