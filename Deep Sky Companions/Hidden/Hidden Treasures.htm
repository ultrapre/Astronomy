<p class="font18" style="text-align:justify;padding:0pt 0pt 13pt 0pt;">This new and exciting observing guide spotlights an original selection of 109 deep-sky objects that&nbsp;will appeal to sky-watchers worldwide. Stephen&nbsp;James O'Meara's ‘hidden treasures' include a&nbsp;wonderful assortment of galaxies, open clusters,&nbsp;planetary nebula and more, all of which have&nbsp;been carefully chosen based on their popularity and ease of observing. None of these objects&nbsp;are included in either the Messier or the Caldwell&nbsp;catalogs, and all are visible in a 4-inch telescope&nbsp;under dark skies, Stunning photographs and&nbsp;beautiful drawings accompany detailed visual&nbsp;descriptions of the objects, which include their&nbsp;rich histories and astrophysical significance. The&nbsp;author's original finder charts are designed to&nbsp;help observers get to their targets fast and&nbsp;efficiently.</p>
<p class="font18" style="text-align:justify;padding:0pt 0pt 22pt 0pt;">stephen james o'meara has spent much of his career on the editorial staff of Sky &amp;&nbsp;Telescope magazine. His many astronomical&nbsp;achievements include being the first person to&nbsp;sight Halley's Comet on its 1985 return, he noticing the dark “spokes” in Saturn's B ring before&nbsp;the Voyager 1 spacecraft imaged them, and&nbsp;determining the rotation period of the distant&nbsp;planet Uranus. He received The Texas Star Party&nbsp;Omega Centauri Award for “advancing astronomy through observation, writing, and promotion, and for his love of the sky,” and the International Astronomical Union named asteroid 3637&nbsp;O'Meara in his honor.</p>

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;">We are all treasure hunters – storybook pirates&nbsp;searching for riches in the&nbsp;endless sea above. Taking&nbsp;the helms of our telescopes,&nbsp;we lay a course among&nbsp;the stars with the sails of&nbsp;our imaginations open. And&nbsp;what wonders await us as&nbsp;we make our way through&nbsp;the charted territories of the&nbsp;Milky Way: rich, open clusters of hot, young stars,&nbsp;some still swaddled in their&nbsp;nascent nebulosities; ancient</p><div style="float:right;layout-flow:horizontal;"><img src="Hidden Treasures_files/Hidden Treasures-3.jpg" style="width:256pt;height:180pt;"/></div>

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;">globular clusters, the senior citizens of our galaxy, whose teeming suns are packed&nbsp;together like gold doubloons in a sea chest;&nbsp;there are galaxies too numerous to mention&nbsp;lurking beyond our forest of stars, living out&nbsp;their lives in various stages of evolution; and&nbsp;then there are the ghosts – the smoky shells&nbsp;ofdyingstars,whoseverynatureremindsus&nbsp;of the ultimate fate of our life-giving Sun.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">These celestial treasures cannot be plundered. They can only make us feel, as Joseph Conrad writes in his 1902 adventure novel,&nbsp;<span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Heart of Darkness</span><span class="font19">, “meditative, and fit for&nbsp;nothing but placid staring.” And there are&nbsp;jewels in the night almost too numerous to&nbsp;mention, some of which rarely get viewed by&nbsp;amateur astronomers. That is why novel lists&nbsp;of neglected deep-sky objects are becoming&nbsp;increasingly popular among observers. And&nbsp;that is why I created this book.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;"><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Hidden Treasures</span><span class="font19"> is the third title in my </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Deep-Sky Companions</span><span class="font19"> series – the other&nbsp;two books are </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Deep-Sky Companions: The&nbsp;Messier Objects</span><span class="font19"> and </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Deep-Sky Companions:&nbsp;The Caldwell Objects</span><span class="font19">.

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Some objects in the <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Hidden Treasures</span><span class="font19"> list are surprisingly bright – bright enough to&nbsp;make one ponder why they have been overlooked. For instance, neither the Messier&nbsp;nor the Caldwell lists include NGC 2451, a&nbsp;3rd-magnitude “open star cluster” in Puppis known since the seventeenth century; I&nbsp;place the words “open star cluster” in quotes&nbsp;because recent research has shown that this&nbsp;classic object is not a star cluster but an&nbsp;asterism, a chance grouping of stars (see&nbsp;Hidden Treasure 42). Nor do the Messier and&nbsp;Caldwell lists include the 2nd-magnitude&nbsp;Coma Berenices Cluster, which Ptolemy cat-alogedasa“nebula”inthesixteenthcentury.&nbsp;And as early as ad 964, Al Sufi described what&nbsp;we now call Brocchi's “Cluster,” the famous&nbsp;Coathanger in Sagitta (yet another “cluster”&nbsp;turned asterism). To understand why these&nbsp;objects were not considered, we need to&nbsp;understand the purpose of the Messier and&nbsp;Caldwell catalogs.</span></p></td></tr></table><hr>

<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Despite popular belief, the Messier catalog is not a list of the “brightest and best” deep-sky objects for small telescopes. It&nbsp;is a list of objects that Messier believed&nbsp;could be confused with a comet that was&nbsp;“just beginning to shine.” Its purpose, then,&nbsp;was to help the astronomers of his day,&nbsp;not the celestial tourists of today. Similarly,&nbsp;despite popular belief, the Caldwell catalog does not “pick up” where the Messier&nbsp;catalog left off. In fact, the intent of the&nbsp;Caldwell catalog – to challenge the celestial tourists of today – is just the opposite of the Messier catalog. What's more,&nbsp;Caldwell list's creator, Sir Patrick Caldwell-Moore, selected the objects not because&nbsp;they were the “brightest” and “best” nonMessier objects in the heavens, but because&nbsp;he thought they were either aesthetically&nbsp;pleasing, visually challenging, or astrophys-ically interesting. And while the Caldwell&nbsp;catalog does include some of the most celebrated non-Messier objects in the night&nbsp;sky – the Double Cluster in Perseus, the&nbsp;Eta Carinae Nebula, the great globular clusters Omega Centauri and 47 Tucanae, and&nbsp;more – it also includes some very dim&nbsp;ones: IC 1613 (an irregular barred dwarf&nbsp;galaxy), NGC 7635 (the Bubble Nebula), and&nbsp;Sharpless 2–155 (the Cave Nebula); all targets more suited for astrophotographers or&nbsp;visual observers with large-aperture telescopes.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;padding:0pt 0pt 14pt 0pt;">ThattheMessierandCaldwellcatalogsare different is good. Both challenge modern&nbsp;observers in their own ways. But, as I&nbsp;have said, there are more celestial treasures&nbsp;hidden among the stars, within the grasp&nbsp;of small-aperture telescopes. Clearly then,&nbsp;there is room for another list of 109 objects&nbsp;that will inspire us to get out and observe,&nbsp;to move beyond the Messier and Caldwell&nbsp;catalogs, and to enrich our observing experience.</p></td>
<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font5" style="text-align:justify;">WHAT IS “BEST?”</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;">Some experienced deep-sky observers and several astronomical societies have created&nbsp;lists of what they believe are the “finest”&nbsp;or “best” deep-sky objects in the night sky.&nbsp;Many of these lists include objects in the&nbsp;Messier and Caldwell catalogs, as well as&nbsp;some other very stunning and overwhelmingly popular objects not on these lists. But&nbsp;once you remove these objects, few of these&nbsp;“best-of” lists agree on what is “best” to&nbsp;observe. The fact is if everyone agreed on&nbsp;which objects are the “finest,” we wouldn't&nbsp;need more than one list. The choices would&nbsp;be clear. But they are not.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">When you look up at the sky, what is your favorite star? Which is the “best”&nbsp;constellation? Will others agree? I have&nbsp;many trees and flowers in my yard. Some&nbsp;are my favorites. My wife, Donna, has her&nbsp;favorites too. But do we agree? What about a&nbsp;professional baseball team? Ifwe exclude all&nbsp;the big-name sluggers and pitchers, who's&nbsp;the “best” of the lot? What's your criteria&nbsp;for choosing? Does everyone use the same&nbsp;criteria? Who's your best friend? How do you&nbsp;make such a choice? Will you ever change&nbsp;your mind? Why?</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">So you see the problem. Saying that someone or something isthe “best” is highly subjective, if not extremely personal. The reason the Messier catalog has been so popu-larwithobserversworldwideforcenturiesis because all of the objects are visible in small&nbsp;telescopes. That's not the case with many of&nbsp;the current “best of ” or “finest” lists available today. The irony of the Messier catalog,&nbsp;and we come full circle with this point, is&nbsp;that, despite its wide popular appeal, it is&nbsp;<span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">not</span><span class="font19"> a list of the “brightest” and “best” deepsky objects.</span></p></td></tr></table><hr>

<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;padding:0pt 0pt 14pt 0pt;"><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Hidden Treasures</span><span class="font19"> is </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">not</span><span class="font19"> a list of the “brightest,” the “finest,” or the “best” deepsky objects. </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Hidden Treasures</span><span class="font19"> is a list of&nbsp;109 deep-sky objects not included in the&nbsp;Messier or Caldwell catalogs.

Indeed,&nbsp;many of the objects are not </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">my</span><span class="font19"> favorites. I&nbsp;selected them because they appear on several “best of ” lists, and, when I examined&nbsp;them through my 4-inch telescope, were&nbsp;deemed worthy of inclusion. I went through&nbsp;great strides to make certain that the selection of objects in </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Hidden Treasures</span><span class="font19"> consists,&nbsp;in large, of objects that do not require Herculean efforts to be seen in small telescopes.</span></p>
<p class="font5" style="text-align:justify;">HOW THE 109 HIDDEN TREASURES</p>
<p class="font5" style="text-align:justify;">WERE SELECTED</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Hidden Treasures</span><span class="font19"> is original in its creation and scope. The project's roots extend back&nbsp;to 1994, when I began making observations for </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Deep-Sky Companions: The Caldwell Objects</span><span class="font19">; that's also when I began making systematic sweeps of the night sky for&nbsp;comets with my 4-inch f/5 Tele Vue refractor&nbsp;at 23</span><span class="font5">×</span><span class="font19">. As all comet hunters know, the night&nbsp;sky is filled with masqueraders. Whenever&nbsp;I encountered an object not in the Messier&nbsp;or Caldwell lists, I recorded it in a special log&nbsp;set aside for “Additional Objects” – ones that&nbsp;would form the foundation of the 20 additional objects to be spotlighted in </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Deep-Sky&nbsp;Companions: The Caldwell Objects</span><span class="font19">.</span></p></td>
<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">The name “hidden treasures” evolved over time. Its origins date to April 30, 1997,&nbsp;when I swept up globular cluster NGC 5286&nbsp;in Centaurus, and noted that it was “hidden” inthe glare of M Centauri. Two months&nbsp;later, I encountered another globular cluster, NGC 6441 in Scorpius, “hidden” in the&nbsp;glare of G Scorpii. Then, on the evening&nbsp;of December 27, 1997, I found the galaxy&nbsp;NGC 404 “hidden” in the glare of Beta&nbsp;Andromedae. Suddenly the idea for a new&nbsp;catalog of objects emerged; that evening I&nbsp;sat down and began drafting a short list of&nbsp;potential “hidden treasures”; what started&nbsp;as an investigation in thought turned into a&nbsp;10-year treasure hunt in the sky.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">I decided to call them hidden treasures for four primary reasons. (1) Some of the&nbsp;objects, like NGC 404 (Hidden Treasure 5) or&nbsp;NGC 2024 (Hidden Treasure 34) are bright&nbsp;enough to be seen in binoculars but can&nbsp;be easily overlooked because they lie so&nbsp;close to a bright star. (2) Other objects are&nbsp;overshadowed by a more popular (Messier&nbsp;or Caldwell) object nearby; the naked-eye&nbsp;open cluster NGC 1647 (Hidden Treasure&nbsp;27) lies between the Hyades (Caldwell 41)&nbsp;and Messier 1 (the Crab Nebula). (3) Some&nbsp;brightnebulaearesmall,andtheyappearon&nbsp;star charts as tiny green boxes (sometimes&nbsp;unnumbered), so they are easily overlooked;&nbsp;NGC 1333 (Hidden Treasure 15) in Perseus is&nbsp;a beautiful reflection nebula that appears on&nbsp;many popular star charts as abox, no bigger&nbsp;than the symbol for a 4th-magnitude star,&nbsp;and NGC 2163 (Hidden Treasure 35), aside&nbsp;from being totally obscure, isa stunning, bipolar planetary nebula in Orion visible in&nbsp;a 2-inch refractor. And (4) some objects –&nbsp;such as the “peculiar planetary” NGC 1360&nbsp;in Fornax – just seem to lie in regions of sky&nbsp;that are, for one reason or another, neglected&nbsp;by observers due to the lack of bright stars&nbsp;nearby. <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Hidden Treasures</span><span class="font19">, then, will open&nbsp;up a whole new window on the universe&nbsp;for small-telescope users who want to move&nbsp;beyond the Messier and Caldwell catalogs.</span></p></td></tr></table><hr>

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;padding:0pt 0pt 14pt 0pt;">When I began my treasure hunt in December 1997, I recorded only objects that were easy to see (meaning visible at a glance),&nbsp;or ones that had immediate <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">“wow</span><span class="font19"> appeal.”&nbsp;The list grew from about two dozen objects&nbsp;in 1998 to about 125 objects by the end of&nbsp;2001.

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;">I suspected that once all the Messier and Caldwell objects were removed from these&nbsp;lists, the overlap would not be overwhelming. I was right. The reasons are many. Some&nbsp;of the lists are for Southern Hemisphere&nbsp;observers, others for Northern Hemisphere&nbsp;observers. The lists also vary depending on&nbsp;the observer's latitude: the list created by&nbsp;the Albuquerque Astronomical Society, for&nbsp;instance, includes more southern objects&nbsp;than does that for the Royal Astronomical&nbsp;Society of Canada. Some of the lists include&nbsp;double and multiple stars, others do not. It&nbsp;also became clear that few of these lists were&nbsp;created solely for the benefit of the smalltelescope user.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">The challenge I faced was to try and make a compelling list of new deep-sky objects&nbsp;that do not appear in the Messier and Caldwell catalogs, are about 10<span class="font2"><sup>◦</sup> </span><span class="font19">above the horizon from latitude 40</span><span class="font2"><sup>◦</sup> </span><span class="font19">north, and can be seen&nbsp;in a 4-inch telescope under a dark sky. To&nbsp;achieve that goal, I went through each list&nbsp;and removed all the Messier and Caldwell&nbsp;objects, followed by the 75 objects I had in&nbsp;my personal hidden treasures list. Next, I&nbsp;removed any objects that could not be seen&nbsp;from my latitude criteria. That left me with&nbsp;75objectsfrommyoriginalhiddentreasures&nbsp;list and some 80 additional objects from the&nbsp;other lists.</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">I needed only 129 objects (the 109 hidden treasures plus 20 additional objects), so I further refined the list by including only&nbsp;those objects (with a few exceptions) that&nbsp;appeared in two or more of the selected&nbsp;lists. Since I did not know what their objects&nbsp;looked like through a small telescope (many&nbsp;of the lists used in this comparison were&nbsp;created for observers using larger scopes),&nbsp;I went out and observed all of them with my&nbsp;4-inch telescope over the course of a year,&nbsp;and removed from the list any objects I could&nbsp;not see, or found very difficult to see.</p></td></tr></table><hr>

<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;padding:0pt 0pt 14pt 0pt;">In time the concept of the Hidden Treasures list evolved further. After sifting&nbsp;through the Messier and Caldwell lists, I&nbsp;realized that they contain a wealth of deepsky objects discovered prior to September 1782, when William Herschel began his&nbsp;great deep-sky survey. I wondered how difficult it would be to complete that historical list, to include in <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Deep-Sky Companions:&nbsp;Hidden Treasures</span><span class="font19"> all the other deep-sky&nbsp;objects that did not make it into those lists.&nbsp;It turned out that the task could be accomplished with minimal effort, as long as I&nbsp;discounted all double or multiple stars mistaken for nebulae, any questionable or missing objects, and the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds. Therefore, anyone who buys&nbsp;thefirstthreevolumesof</span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Deep-SkyCompan-ions</span><span class="font19"> will have at their fingertips the history&nbsp;and astrophysics of every deep-sky object&nbsp;discovered prior to 1782 – up to and including the discoveries made by Caroline Herschel. Six of these objects, all discovered by&nbsp;Abbe´ Nicolas Louis de Lacaille, cannot be&nbsp;seen from latitude 40</span><span class="font2"><sup>◦</sup> </span><span class="font19">north, but they are&nbsp;bright southern-sky objects. Therefore, only&nbsp;about 103 objects will be 10</span><span class="font2"><sup>◦</sup> </span><span class="font19">or higher in the&nbsp;sky as seen from a latitude of 40</span><span class="font2"><sup>◦</sup> </span><span class="font19">north; I say,&nbsp;“about,” because one object, NGC 1291, a&nbsp;fantastic galaxy in Eridanus, is only 1</span><span class="font2"><sup>◦</sup> </span><span class="font19">south&nbsp;of that cut-off point.</span></p>
<p class="font5" style="text-align:justify;">THE FINAL LIST</p></td>
<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;">The final Hidden Treasures list did not end with the addition of the historical objects. In&nbsp;fact, the list changed more than two dozen&nbsp;times in the course of 10 years. Sometimes I&nbsp;would either come across a new object in a&nbsp;comet sweep, other times I would learn of a&nbsp;neglected object in a literature sweep. It was&nbsp;incredibly difficult at times to decide which&nbsp;objects should be included in the main list.&nbsp;For instance, shortly before I finalized my&nbsp;list, I decided to pull two of my favorite&nbsp;galaxies – NGC 134, in Sculptor, and NGC&nbsp;5907, in Draco – because I thought they&nbsp;might be a tad too faint for some smalltelescope users. I replaced them with two&nbsp;unanimously “better” and brighter objects.&nbsp;Actually, creating this book was a great&nbsp;learningexperiencefor me, because, thanks&nbsp;to the “best-of” lists mentioned above, I got&nbsp;to see for the first time so many new and&nbsp;wondrous objects. So the Hidden Treasures&nbsp;list is really, in large part, one created by&nbsp;the collective “you.” To illustrate this point,&nbsp;I have, in Appendix D, included a deepsky list comparison table, so you can see at&nbsp;first hand which individuals, or astronomical societies, thought any particular object&nbsp;was worthy of your time.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">The final 109 hidden treasures comprise 38 open star clusters, 35 galaxies, 14 planetary nebulae, eight globular star clusters,&nbsp;eight bright nebulae, one dark nebula, one&nbsp;star of high-proper-motion, and four officially recognized asterisms (two of which&nbsp;were formerly known as clusters and one&nbsp;of which I had independently discovered).&nbsp;In the Messier catalog, M7 is the most&nbsp;southerly object with a declination of 35<span class="font2"><sup>◦</sup> </span><span class="font19">.&nbsp;Again, all but six of the entries culminate&nbsp;10</span><span class="font2"><sup>◦</sup> </span><span class="font19">above the southern horizon from a latitude 40</span><span class="font2"><sup>◦</sup> </span><span class="font19">north. All are visible in a 4-inch telescope under a clear, dark sky. In fact, the vast&nbsp;majority of them can be seen (some with&nbsp;effort) in a nineteenth-century, brass spyglass or 7 </span><span class="font5">× </span><span class="font19">50 binoculars under the same&nbsp;dark-sky conditions.</span></p>

<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">The Hidden Treasures list includes the brightest, smallest, most unusual, and,&nbsp;arguably, <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">the</span><span class="font19"> most fascinating planetary&nbsp;nebulae in the night sky. It also includes a&nbsp;double cluster of stars in Perseus, i.e. not&nbsp;</span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">the</span><span class="font19"> Double Cluster, bubbling cauldrons of&nbsp;vapor that mark the sites of intense star&nbsp;formation, starburst galaxies that can manufacture suns at the phenomenal rate of&nbsp;hundreds of millions per year, open clusters so young that the earliest ancestors of&nbsp;humans could have seen them just beginning to shine, and globular clusters so old&nbsp;that they just may be as old as the universe&nbsp;itself. There's a pair of interacting galaxies&nbsp;that are pivotal to Halton Arp's redshift argument (which challenges the almost universally held belief that the large redshifts of&nbsp;quasars and other active galaxies are due&nbsp;to cosmic expansion), and a galaxy whose&nbsp;core may harbor a 10-million-solar-mass&nbsp;black hole. Pink planetaries, yellow globu-lars, blue clusters, black clouds, they're all&nbsp;here.</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">As with <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Deep-Sky Companions: The Messier Objects</span><span class="font19"> and </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Deep-Sky Companions:&nbsp;The Caldwell Objects</span><span class="font19">, the purpose of this&nbsp;book is to offer new and fresh perspectives&nbsp;on the history and visual appearance of&nbsp;each object; to help you find each object;&nbsp;and to summarize the latest research&nbsp;findings on each. In Chapter 1, “About this&nbsp;book,” I discuss the telescopes I used to&nbsp;observe the hidden treasures, my observing&nbsp;sites and methods, helpful observing hints,&nbsp;and more. Since the history, astrophysics,&nbsp;and visual descriptions of many of these&nbsp;objects have never been described at length&nbsp;in any other popular work, this chapter&nbsp;also explains my approach to presenting&nbsp;the information. I detail the 109 hidden&nbsp;treasures in Chapter 2. In many cases&nbsp;the essays describe recent observations&nbsp;from the Hubble Space Telescope, the&nbsp;world's largest ground-based telescopes,&nbsp;and a fleet of spacecraft that now peer (or&nbsp;have peered) into the universe with X-ray&nbsp;and infrared-sensitive “eyes.” The essays&nbsp;are also flush with historical anecdotes,&nbsp;including solutions to some outstanding mysteries (including the debate over&nbsp;whether M102 is NGC 5866); observational&nbsp;challenges (naked eye and telescopic);&nbsp;and descriptions of other interesting&nbsp;objects.</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Several appendices complete the work. Appendix A is an informative biography of Caroline Herschel written by the&nbsp;esteemed deep-sky observer Barbara Wilson of Houston, Texas. Its intent is not&nbsp;only to complement Larry Mitchell's biography of William Herschel that appears&nbsp;in Appendix C of <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Deep-Sky Companions:&nbsp;The Caldwell Objects</span><span class="font19">, but also to demonstrate how important Caroline's discoveries were to astronomy. The biography is&nbsp;fresh, written from a woman's perspective,&nbsp;and includes several surprises – namely it&nbsp;removes from Caroline Herschel's list of discoveries some objects we have long admired&nbsp;and replaces them with objects that, until&nbsp;recently,nooneknewshehaddiscovered.So&nbsp;it is an exciting read. Appendix B tabulates&nbsp;each hidden treasure's position, type, angular size, and apparent magnitude. Appendix&nbsp;C does the same for the 20 additional hidden treasures. Appendix D is a table that&nbsp;lists each hidden treasure and shows which&nbsp;individuals or astronomical societies considered it to be one of the finest in the night&nbsp;sky, or whether it was included for purely&nbsp;historical reasons. At the end of the book,&nbsp;“The treasure chest,” is a place for you to&nbsp;“store” each hidden treasure you find. It is,&nbsp;in essence, a checklist. It includes spaces&nbsp;for you to write down important information, such as the date observed, your location, the telescope and magnification used,&nbsp;atmospheric seeing and transparency, and&nbsp;any other special notes you want to record.&nbsp;It is a personal log that you can return to&nbsp;weeks, months, or years later to see how you&nbsp;are progressing as an observer.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;"><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Deep-Sky Companions: Hidden Treasures </span><span class="font19">is more, much more, than a valuable&nbsp;resource, or a companion to </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Deep-Sky&nbsp;Companions: The Messier Objects</span><span class="font19"> and </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">DeepSky Companions: The Caldwell Objects</span><span class="font19">; it is&nbsp;</span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">your</span><span class="font19"> companion under the stars.

The beauty of the hidden treasures&nbsp;list is that it includes a little something of us&nbsp;all. If there is one thing we amateurs know&nbsp;how to do it is to share – our thoughts, our&nbsp;experiences, and, most of all, our passion&nbsp;for the stars.

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;">Just as no pirate sails alone, no author works in complete isolation. I, in fact,&nbsp;had a band of loyal compatriots assisting me&nbsp;in this project. First I'd like to fire a salute&nbsp;to all the observers and amateur astronomy&nbsp;organizations who promote deep-sky lists&nbsp;that go beyond the Messier objects. These&nbsp;lists helped me to steer my telescope toward&nbsp;objects of popular desire. And thank you Al&nbsp;Nagler of Tele Vue Optics for creating such a&nbsp;wonderful “star ship,” which has taken me&nbsp;on countless adventures. Special thanks to&nbsp;Ian Cooper, New Zealand's premier deepsky observer, for educating me on some of&nbsp;the more popular deep-sky objects visible&nbsp;from the southern skies, and James Mullaney for keeping me abreast of the finest&nbsp;northern deep-sky wonders.</p>

His insight&nbsp;into the history of astronomy and the discovery of deep-sky objects (especially of star&nbsp;clusters) has proven invaluable. Archinal&nbsp;also reviewed the science in my open cluster essays. Likewise, very special thanks go&nbsp;out to Sun Kwok for reviewing the science in&nbsp;my planetary nebula essays and to William&nbsp;Harris for his reviewing of my globular cluster essays. Charles Lada scanned my coverage of the diffuse nebulae andLarryMitchell&nbsp;reviewed, and contributed to, my essays on&nbsp;galaxies. Thank you, all of you, for your valuable time and patience. The book would not&nbsp;be the same without your critiques.</span></p></td>

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">A 20-cannon salute goes out to my longdistance friend and fellow sky pirate Barbara Wilson, whose fresh and well-researched&nbsp;history of Caroline Herschel gave me a&nbsp;renewed respect for this great woman. Wilson's history of Caroline had the added benefit of being reviewed by astronomical historian Michael Hoskin, who had recently&nbsp;solved many of the mysteries surrounding&nbsp;objects discovered by, or supposedly discovered by, Caroline Herschel. Hoskin also&nbsp;supplied Barbara with Caroline's original&nbsp;observing records, which led to further sur-prisesaboutherobservationsandsomenew&nbsp;insights into her discoveries.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">A special thanks goes out to my longtime friend Daniel W. E.

Dan also reviewed Wilson's summary of Caroline Herschel's comet&nbsp;discoveries. <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Sky &amp; Telescope</span><span class="font19"> senior editor&nbsp;Dennis di Cicco helped me in my research&nbsp;on the Northern Coalsack; he and fellow&nbsp;senior editor Roger W.

I&nbsp;also thank my friend and astrophotographer Adriana Sherman of Guatemala, who&nbsp;donated her fine images of NGC 2903 in Leo&nbsp;and the field around NGC 2024 in Orion.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">No thank you is long enough, or great enough, to acknowledge my loving wife,&nbsp;Donna, and Daisy Duke, our adorable papil-lon, for tolerating this rogue sailor who&nbsp;would suddenly cast off on many a clear&nbsp;night and not return 'til morning. They&nbsp;understood the cause was noble. I have been&nbsp;a celestial privateer for Simon Mitton at&nbsp;Cambridge University Press, amassing treasures for a book that promised to enrich&nbsp;the lives of observers around the globe. The&nbsp;journey would not have been possible were&nbsp;it not for his generous support. Thank you&nbsp;Simon for believing in the project and publishing the work. And thank you Jacqueline Garget, my editor at CUP, for taking the&nbsp;project through to completion. Of course, I&nbsp;have had the final say in all matters regarding the accuracy of the text.

The book's authors,&nbsp;Joseph Miles Chamberlain and Thomas D.&nbsp;Nicholson, described the cluster as a “huge&nbsp;ball of stars . . . so numerous that the center . . . resembled a brilliant mass of light.”&nbsp;My Golden Guide, <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">The Sky Observer's Guide</span><span class="font19">,&nbsp;went one step further, saying that this “globular may have 100,000 [stars].” It also said it&nbsp;may be seen with the naked eye.</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">It seemed incredible to me at the time that if I could first find the Keystone of Hercules&nbsp;among the multitude of stars overhead, I&nbsp;could then search for a citadel of 100,000&nbsp;suns – one so distant and so tightly packed&nbsp;together (yet so bright) that I could see it&nbsp;with the naked eye as a hazy star.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">I was still learning the constellations at the time, so I had to be certain that I had the&nbsp;right keystone. The search was glamorous&nbsp;in itself, because it made me feel the thrill of&nbsp;voyage. I was a flesh-and-blood Jim Hawkins&nbsp;(the protagonist in Robert Louis Stevenson's <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Treasure Island</span><span class="font19">) in search of “buried”&nbsp;cache.</span></p></td>
<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">When I finally convinced myself that I had the right keystone, I could scarce believe&nbsp;that the dim smudge I was seeing was&nbsp;the great cluster. So I dashed inside the&nbsp;house, grabbed my father's binoculars, and&nbsp;returned to the chill of the night. After a few&nbsp;minutes of letting my eyes readjust to the&nbsp;darkness, I set out again to search for the&nbsp;keystone. This time, when I spied it, and&nbsp;the little smudge within, I raised the binoculars to the spot and began “bobbing” for the&nbsp;cluster – I was still learning how to use binoculars, so they were quite unsteady. It took a&nbsp;while, butin timeI saw a globe of white light&nbsp;flash through the field of view. I narrowed&nbsp;my bobs until I held the object steady. The&nbsp;cluster was small, misty, and round. I saw no&nbsp;teeming masses of suns, no glints of scintillating starlight, just a tiny cloud of light.&nbsp;But I was not disappointed. To a kid just&nbsp;beginning to fathom the universe, the mist&nbsp;of M13 was one of the most majestic sights</p></td></tr></table><hr>

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;padding:0pt 0pt 14pt 0pt;">I've never lost that childhood wonder. In fact, that same fascination guided me in the&nbsp;making of this book.</p>
<p class="font5" style="text-align:justify;">THE TELESCOPE AND SITE</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;">All the observations for this book were made from the Big Island of Hawaii, where I live.&nbsp;Myobservingsiteisnearthe4,200-foot-high&nbsp;summit of Kilauea, a gently sloping shield&nbsp;volcano that has been in near-continuous&nbsp;eruption since January 1983. This is the&nbsp;same general area (as the Hawaiian hoary&nbsp;bat flies) where I made the observations for&nbsp;<span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Deep-Sky Companions: The Messier Objects&nbsp;</span><span class="font19">and </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Deep-Sky Companions: The Caldwell&nbsp;Objects.</span><span class="font19"> But after the latter title was published, I decided to change my observing&nbsp;site because tourist traffic was becoming a&nbsp;nuisance. My new site is more secluded, so I&nbsp;observefewercarheadlightsthroughmyold&nbsp;Tele Vue 4-inch f/5 Genesis refractor. Since&nbsp;clouds could blow in unexpectedly at any&nbsp;time, I needed to be migratory; on occasion I had to drive a few thousand feet to&nbsp;get above the clouds to observe a hidden&nbsp;treasure. The photograph above is an aerial&nbsp;shot showing the summit area of Kilauea&nbsp;volcano where the observations were made.&nbsp;The circular depression near the middle of&nbsp;this frame is the summit crater of Kilauea,&nbsp;called Halemaumau, which spans 1000 feet&nbsp;(305 meters).</span></p></td>
<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;padding:0pt 0pt 19pt 0pt;">After I completed the observations for <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Deep-Sky Companions: The Caldwell&nbsp;Objects</span><span class="font19">, I called Tele Vue founder, Al Nagler,&nbsp;and asked if his company could, once&nbsp;again, clean up an old friend. (If you've&nbsp;read </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Deep-Sky Companions: The Caldwell&nbsp;Objects</span><span class="font19">, you'll know that after four years&nbsp;of exposure to the acidic gases escaping&nbsp;from Kilauea volcano, I had to have the&nbsp;telescope's optics cleaned, which, when&nbsp;Nagler saw them, almost caused him to&nbsp;faint.) After a long moment of silence – the&nbsp;kind one expects when asked to pray for the&nbsp;loss of a loved one – Al conceded to operate.&nbsp;I got my Genesis back, this time with a</span></p><img src="Hidden Treasures_files/Hidden Treasures-6.jpg" style="width:185pt;height:277pt;"/></td></tr></table><hr>

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;">card from the optician who wondered if there was any way, in the future, I could&nbsp;not place the telescope in the direct path&nbsp;of any sulfuric acid clouds. I promised to&nbsp;try.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">For the <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Hidden Treasures</span><span class="font19"> project, I used three eyepieces (also made by Tele Vue):&nbsp;a 22-mm Panoptic, a 7-mm Nagler, and a&nbsp;4.8-mm Nagler. On the Genesis these eyepieces provide magnifications of 23</span><span class="font5">×</span><span class="font19">, 72</span><span class="font5">×</span><span class="font19">,&nbsp;and 105</span><span class="font5">×</span><span class="font19">, respectively. A 1.8</span><span class="font5">× </span><span class="font19">Barlow lens&nbsp;gave me additional magnifications of 41</span><span class="font5">×</span><span class="font19">,&nbsp;130</span><span class="font5">×</span><span class="font19">, and 189</span><span class="font5">×</span><span class="font19">, while a 3</span><span class="font5">× </span><span class="font19">Barlow gave&nbsp;me high powers of 216</span><span class="font5">× </span><span class="font19">and 315</span><span class="font5">×</span><span class="font19">. In addition, I now own a Nagler 3–6-mm zoom&nbsp;eyepiece, which when used&nbsp;together with my Barlow&nbsp;lenses offers me a wide variety of magnifications ranging from 84</span><span class="font5">× </span><span class="font19">to 504</span><span class="font5">×</span><span class="font19">. As a&nbsp;finder I use a Tele Vue Qwik&nbsp;Point (it's like a laser pointer).&nbsp;The Genesis offers me a field&nbsp;of view near 3</span><span class="font2"><sup>◦</sup> </span><span class="font19">wide when I&nbsp;use the 22-mm Panoptic. The&nbsp;telescope sits in the cradle&nbsp;of a sturdy Gibraltar mount,&nbsp;and the entire set up can&nbsp;be broken down in two minutes in case I need to be&nbsp;mobile.</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">In addition to the Tele Vue 4-inch, I also used a beautiful nineteenth-century brass&nbsp;telescope made by Ross of London. It was&nbsp;a Christmas present from my wife, Donna,&nbsp;who bought it while we were in South Africa&nbsp;during a solar-eclipse cruise in December&nbsp;2002. I was, at the time, visiting the site&nbsp;where John Herschel had made his great survey of the southern sky, and Donna was off&nbsp;exploring the Capetown area.

<p class="font5" style="text-align:justify;">HOW TO USE THIS BOOK</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;">To find a hidden treasure, first locate the object's position on the wide-field finder&nbsp;chart that opens each entry. In keeping with&nbsp;the book's theme of hidden treasure, “X”&nbsp;marks the spot; actually “HT X” marks the&nbsp;spot. (Note that the “X” will most likely not&nbsp;be centered onthe map, so you have to hunt&nbsp;a bit to locate it among the stars.) Take note&nbsp;of the brightest stars (those with Greek letters or Flamsteed numbers) near your hidden treasure. Next, locate those stars on the&nbsp;detailed finder chart that accompanies the&nbsp;object's photograph and text (like the wide-field finder chart, the detailed finder charts&nbsp;are oriented with north up and west to the&nbsp;right). Finally, find the part of the text that&nbsp;describes how to locate the object and simply follow the directions.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">After the full-page wide-field finder chart, each object's entry in Chapter 2 opens with&nbsp;a photograph of the object (oriented with&nbsp;north up and west to the right, unless otherwise noted) and a list of essential data:&nbsp;hidden treasure number; common name(s),&nbsp;if any; object type; constellation; equinox&nbsp;2000.0 coordinates; apparent magnitude;&nbsp;angular size or dimensions; surface brightness in magnitudes per square arcminute&nbsp;(for galaxies); distance; and the object's&nbsp;discoverer and discovery date. The text&nbsp;includes a history of the object's discovery;&nbsp;recent research findings; naked-eye or&nbsp;binocular impressions; the object's appearance through the 4-inch Genesis refractor&nbsp;at various magnifications; descriptions by&nbsp;other observers using larger instruments; a&nbsp;visual challenge or two; and brief notes on&nbsp;any interesting objects in the same region of&nbsp;sky.</p></td>
<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">A “drawing” also accompanies the text, so you can compare your view of any hidden&nbsp;treasure with my own. The views may be&nbsp;very dissimilar, but that's okay; we all see&nbsp;things differently.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">You'll find William Herschel's original published description of the object or, if&nbsp;William did not observe the object, his son&nbsp;John's. If neither observer discovered or&nbsp;observed the object, that section is blank.&nbsp;Larry Mitchell, a member of the Houston Astronomical Society, supplied me with&nbsp;William's original notes, which he drew from&nbsp;his original catalogs as they appeared in&nbsp;the <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Philosophical Transactions</span><span class="font19"> of the Royal&nbsp;Society of England.</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">John Herschel's quotations have been gleaned from those given by the “Deepsky&nbsp;Observer's Companion” (<a href="http://www.fortunecity">www.fortunecity</a>.&nbsp;com/roswell/borley/49/), which was created by the Astronomical Society of South&nbsp;Africa to promote its Deepsky Observing&nbsp;section. The quotes are from John Herschel's&nbsp;original observations, published in 1847 as&nbsp;“results of Astronomical Observations made&nbsp;during the years 1834, 5, 6, 7 [and] 8, at&nbsp;the Cape of Good Hope; Being the completion of a telescopic survey of the whole&nbsp;surface of the visible heavens, commenced&nbsp;in 1825.” During his stay in South Africa,&nbsp;John Herschel often made several observations of each object. The quotes used in&nbsp;this book's tables, however, refer only to his&nbsp;first observation; a date is given only if the&nbsp;junior Herschel discovered the object. At&nbsp;the end of each Herschel description is a&nbsp;code contained in parentheses (“H I-156,”&nbsp;for instance, or “h 242”). This code dates to&nbsp;a classification system created and used by&nbsp;the Herschels. “H” stands for the elder Herschel and “h” for his son.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">The Roman numeral in William Herschel's system identifies the class into which he&nbsp;placed each object:</p></td></tr></table><hr>

<p class="font19" style="padding:0pt 0pt 27pt 10pt;">As in <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Deep-Sky Companions: The Messier Objects</span><span class="font19">, the data in this book differ&nbsp;from those appearing in older but&nbsp;popular references.

<p class="font5" style="text-align:justify;">THE FINDER CHARTS</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;">The wide-field and detailed star charts in Chapter 2 are unlike any you've seen. They&nbsp;are of my own design. I created them to look,&nbsp;somewhat, like a treasure map. The hidden&nbsp;treasure number and proper name of each&nbsp;object appears at the top of the chart. An&nbsp;astronomical compass rose can be found at&nbsp;the bottom (north is always up and west&nbsp;to the right). A magnitude scale is at left,&nbsp;and a handy reference to the corresponding&nbsp;star chart(s) in Wil Tirion's <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Sky Atlas 2000.0&nbsp;</span><span class="font19">and the </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Uranometria 2000.0</span><span class="font19"> – two of the&nbsp;most popular star atlases used by observers&nbsp;today – are at lower left.</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;padding:0pt 0pt 13pt 0pt;">Of course, since this is a “treasure” map, “X” (actually “HT X”) marks the location of&nbsp;the object you want to find. Note that often&nbsp;the “X” will not be centered on the map,&nbsp;so you may have to hunt a bit to locate it;&nbsp;it may even be close to the margins of the&nbsp;map.

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">The purpose of the wide-field finder charts is simply to show you the brightest constellations or starfields around the&nbsp;hidden treasure. Each show stars roughly&nbsp;to magnitude 6, but generally only in the&nbsp;region around the hidden treasure. Faint&nbsp;stars are more prevalent if the constellation is dim, like Fornax. In creating these&nbsp;charts my philosophy was to get rid of&nbsp;the peripheral noise. Why clutter the view&nbsp;with lots of dim stars and other objects when&nbsp;all you want to do is see where in the sky the&nbsp;hidden treasure lies and which bright stars&nbsp;are nearest to the object?</p></td>

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;padding:0pt 0pt 14pt 0pt;">To find a hidden treasure, then, all you need to do is first locate the object's position on the wide-field finder chart. Next,&nbsp;take note of the brightest stars nearest to&nbsp;the object and locate them on the detailed&nbsp;finder chart. Finally, find the part of the&nbsp;text that describes how to locate the object&nbsp;and simply follow the directions. Nearly all&nbsp;the deep-sky objects mentioned in the text&nbsp;are plotted on the charts, as are named&nbsp;or numbered stars. Sometimes, though,&nbsp;such companion objects or stars being&nbsp;noted are labeled on the photographs rather&nbsp;than on the star charts, especially when&nbsp;the area of interest is small and crowded,&nbsp;as is the case with NGC 281 (Hidden&nbsp;Treasure 3).</p>

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;padding:0pt 0pt 14pt 0pt;">In several cases we have also reproduced images from the Hubble Space Telescope&nbsp;and large telescopes like the Canada–&nbsp;France–Hawaii Telescope atop nearly&nbsp;14,000-foot-high Mauna Kea volcano on&nbsp;the Big Island of Hawaii. These images were&nbsp;used for the sole purpose of inspiring you&nbsp;to use your imagination. You certainly will&nbsp;not see anything like these images when&nbsp;you look through your telescope, but how&nbsp;else can you fully appreciate what it is you&nbsp;are seeing? So do not be discouraged, be&nbsp;enlightened.</p>
<p class="font5" style="text-align:justify;">THE DRAWINGS</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;">All the sketches in Chapter 2 are composites of field drawings I made at various magnifications. They are shown approximately with&nbsp;north up and west to the right, unless otherwise noted. Whenever possible, the orientation matches that of the corresponding photograph. Scale bars are included to help you&nbsp;size up each object in your own telescope.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;padding:0pt 0pt 7pt 0pt;">The composites show details visible at low, medium, and high power. For instance,&nbsp;I might have seen a galaxy's faint halo readily&nbsp;at low power but not at high power. On the&nbsp;other hand, a small knot in that galaxy'sarm&nbsp;might have been obvious at high power but&nbsp;inconspicuous at low power. Both the halo&nbsp;and the knot will appear in my sketch.</p></td></tr></table><hr>

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">The drawings also show details seen in fits andstarts over several hours observing from&nbsp;a dark-sky site. Unless otherwise noted, the&nbsp;drawings all represent views obtained from&nbsp;the area around the 4,200-foot-high summit of Kilauea volcano, an extremely dark&nbsp;location. Under these conditions my 4-inch&nbsp;Genesis will perform as well as an 8- to 10-inch Schmidt-Cassegrain from a suburban&nbsp;site. This means that the details I portray&nbsp;in my drawings should be within the visual&nbsp;grasp of everyone using the large reflectors&nbsp;and catadioptric telescopes that are so popular today.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">It's important for you to know that I have not always lived under dark skies. In fact, I&nbsp;spent most of my life – between the ages&nbsp;of 6 and 32 – observing under city lights.&nbsp;I was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts,&nbsp;and lived and observed in that city and its&nbsp;surroundings until I moved to Hawaii in&nbsp;December 1994. I know what it is like not&nbsp;to be able to see deep-sky objects even with&nbsp;large telescopes in city environments. Yet I&nbsp;was never discouraged. I never gave in to&nbsp;city lights. I always tried to make the best of&nbsp;every moment I had with my telescope. If I&nbsp;could only see the bright nucleus of a galaxy&nbsp;and not its arms, I sat behind whatever telescope I had and studied that nucleus until&nbsp;my eyes dripped with fatigue.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">At no time did I ever feel inferior to someone seeing spectacular details in a deepsky object that I could barely see from the city. No, those observing reports inspired&nbsp;me, they strengthened my resolve because&nbsp;I knew that some day I would have an&nbsp;opportunity to see what these great visual&nbsp;observers were detecting from their dark&nbsp;skies. In <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Deep-Sky Companions: The Messier&nbsp;Objects</span><span class="font19">, I mention one of the most eyeopening moments of my life. After 30 years&nbsp;of never having seen the galaxy M74, many&nbsp;of them spent looking for it with the 9-inch f/12 Clark refractor at Harvard College&nbsp;Observatory, I got my first look at it shortly&nbsp;after I moved to Hawaii – in 7 </span><span class="font5">× </span><span class="font19">35 binoculars. I can hardly begin to tell you how low&nbsp;my jaw dropped that evening. For the first&nbsp;time inmy life I could now understand these&nbsp;words by Charles Messier: “This nebula...is&nbsp;quite broad, very dim, and extremely difficult to observe.”</span></p></td>
<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">I did not need any prodding to get out under the stars. I had so much to see. A new&nbsp;window on the universe had opened before&nbsp;my eyes, and a new chapter in my life began.&nbsp;I sit behind the telescope and squeeze every&nbsp;photon from every object I observe because&nbsp;like a man who's crossed the desert without water, I am thirsty . . . only my thirst&nbsp;is for starlight. What's interesting is that I&nbsp;went from using a 9-inch refractor on a regular basis under city lights to using a 4-inch&nbsp;refractor under darks, and I'm seeing more&nbsp;in the deep-sky than ever before.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">My <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Deep-Sky Companions</span><span class="font19"> series is not so much a set of books as it is a set of personal&nbsp;diaries, one that I have opened up to you. I&nbsp;want you to know what the possibilities are&nbsp;for you to see under a dark night sky. The&nbsp;irony of it all is that when I was younger, it&nbsp;seemed as if the vast majority of amateurs&nbsp;were living under dark skies except for me.&nbsp;Now, light pollution has become so rampant&nbsp;that it seems as if the vast majority of amateurs are observing under city skies, except&nbsp;for me. It's been like taking a rocket ship back&nbsp;in time.</span></p>

But it's not, it's a choice.&nbsp;If you want to learn how to make the most&nbsp;out of every observation, I suggest you read&nbsp;on.</p>
<p class="font5" style="text-align:justify;">THE PIRATES OF POWER</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;">When we embark on a search for an object – especially one we've never seen before –&nbsp;it's generally best to use the lowest magnification available and a wide field of view.&nbsp;I say generally because the eye's ability to&nbsp;detect an object depends not only on where&nbsp;you place it on your eye's retina but also&nbsp;on the difference in contrast between the&nbsp;object's brightness and the brightness of&nbsp;the background sky; angular size also plays&nbsp;an important part. (A rule of thumb: low&nbsp;power for large objects; high power for small&nbsp;objects.)</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;padding:0pt 0pt 7pt 0pt;">Consider how difficult it is to detect Venus with the unaided eye in broad daylight, as&nbsp;opposed to how easily it is seen on the same&nbsp;night. In both cases, the planet's brightness&nbsp;is the same. The reason we see Venus more&nbsp;easily at night is because the background&nbsp;illumination is dimmer; an object appears&nbsp;brighter if its surroundings are dark. The&nbsp;point is, if you live in or near light-polluted&nbsp;skies, using too low a power will hinder your&nbsp;ability to detect faint stars or low-surface&nbsp;brightness objects, if the contrast difference&nbsp;between the object and sky background is&nbsp;too low.</p></td>
<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">The best way to find the most efficient low powers for you is to experiment with&nbsp;different eyepieces under different sky conditions. Do not be fooled by the seeming&nbsp;exactitude of some equations dealing with&nbsp;object visibility; these equations are general guides at best and do not reflect the&nbsp;full range of possibilities. The only way to&nbsp;determine what you can see is to venture&nbsp;forth and explore. There is no substitute for&nbsp;personal experience, which changes with&nbsp;sky conditions and training. The more you&nbsp;observe, the more adept you will become&nbsp;at seeing finer and finer details; remember, though, that your ability as an observer&nbsp;depends not so much on what you observe,&nbsp;or the number of objects you observe, but&nbsp;how you observe. I'll explain.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Let's imagine we've just embarked on a treasure hunt with our telescopes. Sweeping&nbsp;some 40<span class="font2"><sup>^</sup> </span><span class="font19">northwestofBeta(</span><span class="font5">^</span><span class="font19">)CanesVenati-corum with low power, we spy the ghostly&nbsp;form of NGC 4490 – the Cocoon Galaxy (Hidden Treasure 63). What should we do next?</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">That depends on what kind of observer you are, or want to be. Since this book&nbsp;deals with “hidden treasures,” I thought&nbsp;you'd enjoy the following analogy between&nbsp;the observing habits of two distinct groups&nbsp;of amateur astronomers and the hunting&nbsp;habits of two distinct groups of real-life&nbsp;pirates.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Some observers pursue their targets like the Barbary pirates of old, whose essence&nbsp;of attack was to “hit and run.” In <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Under&nbsp;the Black Flag</span><span class="font19">: </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">The Romance and the Reality of Life Among the Pirates</span><span class="font19">, David Cord-ingly notes, “it is [also] a characteristic of&nbsp;most of today's pirate attacks in Indonesian&nbsp;waters, when pirates may be on board the&nbsp;victim's ship for no more than nine or ten&nbsp;minutes.”</span></p></td></tr></table><hr>

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Astronomical observers of the Barbary type are primarily interested in finding and&nbsp;accumulating as many deep-sky objects as&nbsp;possible. They enjoy the challenge of the&nbsp;hunt and are satisfied when their plan of&nbsp;attack succeeds. They are not interested&nbsp;in spending time “on board” each target,&nbsp;examining it carefully and diligently. After&nbsp;the capture, they figuratively toss the treasure on deck, kick it aside, and sail right on&nbsp;to the next.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">In the case of NGC 4490, Barbary-type observers would revel in their find by holding it in their gaze for a few minutes, then&nbsp;log it as found, before they set sail for more&nbsp;booty. The more treasures they collect, the&nbsp;bigger their bounty, and the happier they&nbsp;become. Astronomy clubs and organizations further entice this type of activity by&nbsp;promising rewards for their hauls – with&nbsp;pins, certificates, and medals. And that's&nbsp;perfectly fine.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">On the other side of the doubloon, however, is the romantic, of which I am one. For us, the hunt is part of a larger adventure.&nbsp;When we “capture” a deep-sky object, we&nbsp;do spend time “on board.” We feel the need&nbsp;to sift deeper, to plumb the depths of each&nbsp;“hold,” knowing that if we do, if we remain&nbsp;patient, we will be rewarded by the sight of&nbsp;even more riches.</p></td>
<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">We are like the pirates who sailed the Caribbean and North American waters during the golden age of piracy, whose essence&nbsp;of attack was a mix of lust and leisure.&nbsp;Consider the experience of Captain Samuel&nbsp;Carey, who was commander of the merchant&nbsp;ship <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Samuel</span><span class="font19"> on July 13, 1720, when it was&nbsp;attacked by pirates 40 miles east of the banks&nbsp;of Newfoundland. The pirates, Cordingly&nbsp;explains, “swarmed on board the </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Samuel&nbsp;</span><span class="font19">and began taking the ship apart. They tore&nbsp;open the hatches and attacked the cargo like&nbsp;madmen . . . When they finished looting the&nbsp;</span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Samuel</span><span class="font19">, the pirates turned their attention to&nbsp;the crew.” The attack lasted 48 hours, and it&nbsp;was typical of dozens like it that occurred in&nbsp;the Caribbean and North American waters&nbsp;in the early eighteenth century. Observers&nbsp;who are like the pirates of the Caribbean&nbsp;do not, metaphorically speaking, seek treasures but treasure chests. The real excitement for us is to “break the lock and open the&nbsp;lid,” to go beyond what's superficially visible, and to rifle through what's inside. Here's&nbsp;an example of how I visually “tear apart” my&nbsp;targets.</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">When I capture a new object, I spend a few minutes making an initial inspection of&nbsp;it at low power, then take a break. I am in&nbsp;no hurry to plunder. I stand up, stretch my&nbsp;arms over my head, take a deep breath, and&nbsp;let myself feel the satisfaction of success.&nbsp;Once my body is relaxed, I reposition myself&nbsp;behind the eyepiece (low power) and relax&nbsp;my gaze. Then, while inhaling and exhaling&nbsp;slowly through my nose, I start my first critical examination.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">I begin by placing the object in my eye's favored hot spot. Doing so allows me to gain&nbsp;an appreciation of the object's brightness,&nbsp;overall shape, and, if it is elongated, orientation. I assess how difficult the object is to&nbsp;see. I look for interesting objects nearby: for&nbsp;instance, in the case of NGC 4490, a tiny&nbsp;12th-magnitude galaxy (NGC 4485) lies just&nbsp;north of NGC 4490's northwest flank; is it visible at low power? Everything I see, or don't&nbsp;see, with my peripheral vision, I record.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Some observers would move on to higher powers at this point, but I don't. While I have&nbsp;gained an excellent impression of what the&nbsp;object looks like in my eye'speriphery,Inow&nbsp;want to know how much detail is visible in</p></td></tr></table><hr>

<td valign="top" width="50%"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"><img src="Hidden Treasures_files/Hidden Treasures-21.png" style="width:432pt;height:52pt;"/></div><br clear="all">
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;">NGC 4490 at low power. To do that I must move the object between the foveal and&nbsp;peripheral regions of the retina. Throughout&nbsp;this process I ask myself questions: Does the&nbsp;galaxy have a bright nucleus or just a core of&nbsp;brightness? Is the halo elongated? Can I see&nbsp;anyspiralstructure or H-II regions? Are stars&nbsp;superimposed on the galaxy? Is one of them&nbsp;a supernova? And so on.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Again, I impose no time constraints on myself. I will observe an object at low power&nbsp;until I feel I have exhausted my vision's&nbsp;potential. Of course, examining something&nbsp;like NGC 4490, a 10th-magnitude barred&nbsp;spiral galaxy some 6<span class="font2"><sup>^</sup> </span><span class="font19">in diameter, does&nbsp;not require as much time to observe as&nbsp;something like Messier 31 (M31), a 3rd-magnitude spiral galaxy spanning 3</span><span class="font2"><sup>◦</sup> </span><span class="font19">of sky.&nbsp;But that's about all one can say about time.&nbsp;Once I have completed my inspection at low&nbsp;power, I repeat the process again at medium&nbsp;power (asking myself the same questions),&nbsp;then again at high magnification.</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">With every increase in power, the peripheral view begins to look more and more like a foveal view at low power, meaning that&nbsp;only the brightest regions of the object are&nbsp;obvious. It will also appear that the contrast between the sky background and the&nbsp;object increases, but it does not; the contrast remains the same; magnification is&nbsp;not selective. The reason has to do, once&nbsp;again, with the physiology of the eye and&nbsp;how it perceives brightness. Brightness is&nbsp;not a physical value but a sensation. “This&nbsp;sensation is roughly, and only roughly,” as&nbsp;Cambridge University psychologist Richard&nbsp;L. Gregory explains, “related to the intensity&nbsp;of the light entering the eye.”</p></td>
<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">A point source of a certain brightness appears more intense to the eye than a diffuse source of the same brightness. That&nbsp;is why a 10th-magnitude star is easier to&nbsp;see at a given power than, say, a 10th-magnitude galaxy several arcminutes in&nbsp;diameter. Higher powers exacerbate this&nbsp;effect. When a diffuse object is magnified,&nbsp;its surface brightness dims because the light&nbsp;is spread over a larger area.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">In the broadest sense, surface brightness is an object's magnitude divided by its area.&nbsp;The typical surface brightness of a galaxy is&nbsp;13.5, meaning that each square arcminute of&nbsp;its area is as bright as a magnitude 13.5 star –&nbsp;or about asbright as Pluto at opposition. But&nbsp;Pluto is a point source in small telescopes;&nbsp;so imagine defocusing Pluto until its light&nbsp;covers an area 1<span class="font2"><sup>^</sup> </span><span class="font19">in diameter. Now imagine magnifying that diffused light from 20</span><span class="font5">×&nbsp;</span><span class="font19">to 200</span><span class="font5">×</span><span class="font19">. That feeble 1</span><span class="font2"><sup>^</sup> </span><span class="font19">disk of light is now&nbsp;spread over an area 10 times larger. The&nbsp;eye's ability to detect that light diminishes&nbsp;in proportion. Now take our example galaxy,&nbsp;NGC 4490, which has a surface brightness&nbsp;of 13.0 (a little brighter than normal). The&nbsp;galaxy is also noted for its bright nucleus,&nbsp;jutting bars, and prominent H-II regions.&nbsp;What happens to the view as we increase&nbsp;magnification? Increasing magnification, of&nbsp;course, helps us to separate individual features crowded in the core. At low power,&nbsp;light from the nucleus, the bars, and the&nbsp;H-II regions can blend to form a single&nbsp;intense core of light. Magnification will help&nbsp;to separate the individual features from the&nbsp;nucleus, better to reveal the nature of the&nbsp;galaxy. Of course, the most feeble portions&nbsp;of its disk will fade away with the highest of&nbsp;powers, leaving only the most compact of&nbsp;details to stand out prominently. ( That is&nbsp;also why it is important to incorporate views&nbsp;at all powers in your drawings.) The most&nbsp;skilledobserverswillalsoknowhowtoscru-tinize these remaining filaments of light</span></p></td></tr></table><hr>

So it is understandable that some observers believe&nbsp;observing in this way is too much work.&nbsp;They much prefer to hunt and find, not sit&nbsp;and analyze. Again, that's okay. Regardless&nbsp;of what type of observer you are, the beauty&nbsp;of astronomy is that it can satisfy the&nbsp;appetite of all manner of celestial pirates.&nbsp;Just remember, though, if you consider&nbsp;yourself a Barbary pirate, do not expect to&nbsp;see the subtle details often described by&nbsp;the pirates of the Caribbean. And if you're&nbsp;a pirate of the Caribbean, do not expect&nbsp;to compete in a race against time with a&nbsp;Barbary pirate . . . and win – they'll “not be&nbsp;beat by man nor devil.” Of course, there are&nbsp;always exceptions to the rule.</p></td></tr></table><hr>

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;">If the messier catalog opens with a bang (M1, the Crab supernova remnant in Taurus) and the Caldwell catalog&nbsp;opens with a whisper (NGC 188, an old&nbsp;and dim open cluster in Cepheus), <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Hidden Treasures</span><span class="font19"> opens with a surprise: NGC&nbsp;189, an 8th-magnitude open cluster in Cassiopeia. The surprise is that indefatigable&nbsp;Caroline Herschel discovered this dim collection of suns in 1783 – a fact that had gone&nbsp;unrecognized for more than two centuries&nbsp;until British astronomical historian Michael&nbsp;Hoskin introduced the world to this fact in&nbsp;the November 2005 </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Journal for the History&nbsp;of Astronomy</span><span class="font19">.</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:9pt;padding:0pt 0pt 10pt 0pt;">While reviewing Caroline Herschel's original observing notes, Hoskin scrutinized the following description of an object Caroline&nbsp;discovered on September 27, 1783, shortly&nbsp;after she had discovered the open cluster&nbsp;NGC 225 (Hidden Treasure 2) on the same&nbsp;evening:</p>
<p class="font18" style="text-align:justify;padding:0pt 0pt 10pt 9pt;">About 1 south of the above cluster [NGC 225] a faint nebula surrounded with a great number&nbsp;of both large and small stars. There are more&nbsp;large stars in the field than are marked here [in&nbsp;a diagram] but I took particular notice of the&nbsp;two between which the nebula is situated . . .&nbsp;Mess[ier] has them not.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;">Hoskin realized that since NGC 225 precedes Gamma (<span class="font5">^ </span><span class="font19">) Cassiopeia, this new object must precede it also. The only deepsky object in the vicinity of Caroline's&nbsp;description is the 8th-magnitude open cluster NGC 189, which lies nearly 1</span><span class="font2"><sup>◦</sup> </span><span class="font19">southwest&nbsp;of NGC 225. “But it is William's VIII.64&nbsp;(NGC 381) that is credited to Caroline,”&nbsp;Hoskin says, “even though this cluster follows Gamma Cas.”</span></p></td>
<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:9pt;">Hoskin's find put my mind at ease. It has long been my contention that NGC 381 is&nbsp;too faint for Caroline to have noticed in&nbsp;a sweep, even with her new 4.2-inch telescope, which had a speculum-metal mirror,&nbsp;at 22<span class="font5">×</span><span class="font19">. NGC 381 is small (7</span><span class="font2"><sup>^</sup> </span><span class="font19">), dim (magnitude 9.3), and has a low surface brightness (13.5). I failed to pick it up in a sweep&nbsp;with my 4-inch at 23</span><span class="font5">×</span><span class="font19">. The cluster lies in&nbsp;an extremely rich Milky Way field full of&nbsp;“fuzzy knots.” I could see NGC 381 as a dull&nbsp;enhancement in the Milky Way only when I&nbsp;knew </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">exactly</span><span class="font19"> where to look. Caroline did not&nbsp;have such an advantage.</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">NGC 189 is not only [0.5]-magnitude brighterthanNGC381,butmorecondensed&nbsp;(5<span class="font2"><sup>^</sup> </span><span class="font19">); it also has a greater surface brightness (12.3). And while NGC 189 is near&nbsp;Dolidze 12 (a slight concentration of Milky&nbsp;Way), Caroline's cluster is clearly isolated&nbsp;from it. The region is also veiled by obscuring dust, making NGC 225 and NGC 189&nbsp;stand out more prominently from the otherwise rich background. NGC 189 was, in&nbsp;fact, quite easy to pick up in a comet sweep&nbsp;with my 4-inch at 23</span><span class="font5">× </span><span class="font19">in astronomical&nbsp;twilight.</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Hoskin's research clearly dismisses NGC 381 as being one of Caroline's discoveries and makes NGC 189 the outstanding&nbsp;solution. “It would seem therefore,” Hoskin&nbsp;says, “that this attribution [of NGC 381] to&nbsp;Caroline is a mistake (perhaps because [it]&nbsp;is positioned between two 6th-magnitude&nbsp;stars 1<span class="font2"><sup>◦</sup> </span><span class="font19">apart), and that in fact she should&nbsp;be credited with NGC 189, an object that&nbsp;William never saw.” Following Hoskin's recommendation, I removed NGC 381 from the&nbsp;</span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Hidden Treasures</span><span class="font19"> list and replaced it with&nbsp;NGC 189. I have placed both NGC 189 and&nbsp;NGC 225 in the same write-up, not only&nbsp;because Caroline Herschel discovered them&nbsp;both on the same night, but, just as Caroline's description of NGC 189 suggests, the&nbsp;best way to find NGC 189 is to first locate&nbsp;brighter and larger NGC 225.</span></p></td></tr></table><hr>

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;padding:0pt 0pt 9pt 0pt;">You'll find NGC 225 just 2<span class="font2"><sup>◦</sup> </span><span class="font19">northwest of Gamma Cas, the central gem of the Celestial&nbsp;W. It is an elegant but neglected open star&nbsp;cluster. Upon her discovery of it, Caroline&nbsp;Herschel wrote,</span></p>

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;">Caroline swept up the cluster four more times in the next five months. Her brother,&nbsp;William, classified it as a Class VIII object&nbsp;(coarsely scattered clusters of stars) and&nbsp;included it in his catalog of nebulae and&nbsp;clusters.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Under a dark sky, NGC 225 lies in a kidneybean-shaped bay in the river Milky Way, exactly halfway between Gamma Cas and&nbsp;4th-magnitude Kappa (<span class="font5">^</span><span class="font19">) Cas. It is also very&nbsp;close to the galactic equator, the dense mid&nbsp;plane of our galaxy, where intervening dust&nbsp;dims the cluster's apparent brightness by&nbsp;about 0.2 magnitude. No matter, the 7th-magnitude glow is easily spied in 7 </span><span class="font5">× </span><span class="font19">50&nbsp;binoculars if you know exactly where to look.&nbsp;It is a fine sight in my antique telescope.&nbsp;Look for a bright chevron of stars with a&nbsp;wavy line of a half-dozen or so stars, oriented northwest–southeast, to the west. The&nbsp;cluster is a “milkweed pod” of hazy suns&nbsp;just east of that wavy line. With imagination&nbsp;it looks as if the pod has just burst open,&nbsp;releasing a flurry of seeds with their silken&nbsp;parachutes.</span></p></td>

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">The dim 9th-magnitude open cluster Stock 24 can be seen about 30<span class="font2"><sup>^</sup> </span><span class="font19">northwest&nbsp;of NGC 225. It marks the northwest edge of&nbsp;the Valentine Heart. Stock 24 is a puny cluster, measuring 5</span><span class="font2"><sup>^</sup> </span><span class="font19">across, and though it is 180&nbsp;stars rich, its brightest member shines at a&nbsp;diminutive 13th magnitude. If you can fit&nbsp;the two clusters in the same field of view,&nbsp;take a moment to ponder their true physical natures. NGC 225 and Stock 24 each span&nbsp;about 9 light-years of space. Stock 24 looks&nbsp;smaller and fainter than NGC 225 because&nbsp;it is nearly three times farther away, which&nbsp;is a shame, because Stock 24 contains more&nbsp;than twice as many stars as does NGC 225.&nbsp;Although the stars of NGC 225 are spread&nbsp;out, making it appear old – as if its mem-bersarelosingtheirgravitationalgriponone&nbsp;another – it is, in fact, a rather young cluster&nbsp;with an ageof about 120 million years, making it almost twice as old as the Pleiades.</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">NGC 225 is easily resolved in a 4-inch telescope. The brightest member shines at magnitude 9.3.

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;">At least that's the way it appears in small apertures.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">At 72 <span class="font5">×</span><span class="font19">, the cluster's stars spread out and lose their appeal. But before you return to&nbsp;low power, take a moment to relax your gaze&nbsp;and scrutinize the scene with a fresh eye.&nbsp;Do you see how that, though the cluster is&nbsp;loose and scattered, its stars are arranged in&nbsp;two distinct regions – a rich section to the&nbsp;southeast (like a lemon slice) and a smaller&nbsp;and sparser congregation to the northwest?&nbsp;If you defocus the view ever so slightly and&nbsp;tap the tube, you should see that these two&nbsp;regions are separated by a meandering lane&nbsp;of darkness. The nineteenth-centuryBritish&nbsp;observer,Adm.WilliamHenrySmyth,noted&nbsp;this effect as well, writing that the object is&nbsp;a “small double star, in a loose cluster of&nbsp;about thirty of the 9th and 10th magnitudes,&nbsp;occupying all the field; but there being no&nbsp;stardust, or nebulosity intermixed, the firmament appears unusually dark between&nbsp;them.”</span></p></td>
<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Interestingly, while Smyth notes that no nebulosity exists here, Caroline&nbsp;Herschel, in her discovery&nbsp;description, suspected it&nbsp;did. And it does. The brightest section surrounds the&nbsp;11th-magnitude star BD <span class="font5">+</span><span class="font19">61&nbsp;154 at the northern fringe&nbsp;of the cluster and is clearly&nbsp;visible in the photograph&nbsp;above. Smyth probably did&nbsp;not see it because he was&nbsp;using a long-focus refractor.&nbsp;Seeing the dim nebula may&nbsp;require a rich-field telescope,&nbsp;like the one that Caroline&nbsp;used, under dark skies – one&nbsp;that will condense the faint&nbsp;light. What is the smallest telescope that&nbsp;will show it? Chuck Layton of Tacoma,&nbsp;Washington, writes that he could not see&nbsp;it in an 8-inch f/6 Newtonian from suburban skies; and William L. Schart of Killeen,&nbsp;Texas, also failed with an 8-inch Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope at 77</span><span class="font5">×</span><span class="font19">. At times I suspected it in the 4-inch at 23</span><span class="font5">×</span><span class="font19">, and at other&nbsp;times not. Perhaps the use of a nebula filter&nbsp;is the solution.</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Regardless of the nebula's visibility, NGC 225 is one cluster that plays with the imagination. With averted vision in the antique&nbsp;telescope, the cluster resembles the Greek&nbsp;letter omega (<span class="font5">^</span><span class="font19">), or, better yet, it mimics&nbsp;the larger Celestial W, in which it lies – an&nbsp;aspect first noted by the Rev. Thomas W.&nbsp;Webb in the nineteenth century. In more&nbsp;modern terms, Rod Pommier nicknamed&nbsp;it the Sailboat Cluster, and Jim Anderson&nbsp;of Phelps Lake, North Carolina, notes that&nbsp;when seen simply inverted, the “grouping&nbsp;forms a figure that resembles a stooping&nbsp;falcon with wings arched upward and the&nbsp;pinions extending downward, the head and&nbsp;legs extended to strike its prey . . . Let your&nbsp;imagination run amuck.” If you want that&nbsp;“visual punch,” keep the stars, which cover&nbsp;an area the size of a quarter Moon, tightly&nbsp;packed at low power. Increased magnification will only darken, or diminish, the&nbsp;view...andyourimagination.</span></p></td></tr></table><hr>

<td valign="top" width="50%">

Compared to large and scattered&nbsp;NGC 225, NGC 189 is small and round. It&nbsp;also has a beautiful bluish cometlike sheen&nbsp;that stands out distinctly from the background, especially when seen together with&nbsp;NGC 225. NGC 189 lies immediately north&nbsp;of a 7</span><span class="font2"><sup>^</sup> </span><span class="font19">-wide trapezoid of four 9th- and&nbsp;10th-magnitude suns. In photographs, the&nbsp;cluster resides within a comparatively rich&nbsp;region bordering the heavily obscured sack&nbsp;of dark nebulosity within which NGC 225&nbsp;is located. A study of the region by George&nbsp;Alter reveals that the background density is,&nbsp;however, about half that of the other clusters&nbsp;in the neighborhood so that some absorption might justifiably be assumed. NGC 189&nbsp;is only 4,000 light-years more distant than&nbsp;NGC 225, but it is six times younger.

The hidden treasure you seek,&nbsp;then, is NGC 281 (the nebula). IC 1590 (the&nbsp;cluster) is a visual bonus – like the inlaid&nbsp;gems and precious stones that adorn the&nbsp;Taj Mahal's majestic white marble edifice.</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Edward Emerson Barnard (1857–1923) discovered NGC 281 visually on November&nbsp;26, 1881. Recently married and caring for&nbsp;his invalidmother,Barnard was, at the time,&nbsp;trying to strengthen his financial situation.&nbsp;During the day he worked at Poole's Photograph Gallery in Nashville, Tennessee. At&nbsp;night, he used a 5-inch Byrne refractor to&nbsp;scan the skies for comets. He was also trying&nbsp;his hand at raising chickens. The discovery&nbsp;of NGC 281 came while he was feverishly in&nbsp;quest of the US $200 Warner prize; in 1881&nbsp;H. H. Warner (a wealthy patron of astronomy from Rochester, New York) announced&nbsp;that he would award a gold medal and US&nbsp;$200 in cash for the first American discoverer of each new comet. Barnard quickly&nbsp;sniffed out a road to success. On the evening&nbsp;of September 17, 1881, he discovered an 8th-magnitude comet low in the western sky.&nbsp;Although the comet did not become a visual&nbsp;spectacle, it did bring him his first Warner&nbsp;prize – part of which he used to purchase a&nbsp;tiny plot of land in Nashville, on which he&nbsp;then financed a home. And it was from this&nbsp;new home, “on a beautiful rising ground”&nbsp;with a clear horizon, that he discovered the&nbsp;new nebula.<a name="footnote1"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark27">1</a></sup><span class="font17"><sup></sup></span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">The discovery of NGC 281, of course, was a financial disappointment; new comets,&nbsp;not new nebulae, paid. No matter, Barnard&nbsp;went on to discover 16 comets, five of which&nbsp;earned him Warner prizes – enough to pay&nbsp;off the mortgage of his new home, which&nbsp;he named “Comet House.” Although new&nbsp;nebulae did not bring any financial rewards,&nbsp;they still intrigued him, especially since no&nbsp;one could yet explain their nature.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Despite the great sky surveys conducted by the Herschels and other celestial treasure hunters over the last century and more,&nbsp;nebulae visible in small telescopes were&nbsp;still being discovered. “While some nebulae&nbsp;could easily be recognized by their fantastic forms,” William Sheehan writes in <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">The&nbsp;Immortal Fire Within: The Life and Work&nbsp;of Edward Emerson Barnard</span><span class="font19">, “the majority were, at least in the 5-inch telescope&nbsp;Barnard used, ‘roundish patches of foggy&nbsp;matter, extremely like comets in appearance'.” NGC 281 is no exception; with its&nbsp;curious parabolic shape, the 7th-magnitude&nbsp;glow looks very much like the head of a new&nbsp;comet just beginning to grow a tail.</span></p></td>
<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">The question is how could such an object, one that is visible in binoculars today, have&nbsp;gone unnoticed for so long? The answer is&nbsp;twofold. First, the nebula is large (35<span class="font2"><sup>^</sup> </span><span class="font5">× </span><span class="font19">30</span><span class="font2"><sup>^</sup> </span><span class="font19">),&nbsp;larger than the full Moon, and its surface&nbsp;brightness is low (23.6), so the great William&nbsp;Herschel hadn't much of a chance to spy it&nbsp;in his narrow 15</span><span class="font2"><sup>^</sup> </span><span class="font19">field of view (which is what&nbsp;he used during his sweeps). Second, it's possible that comet hunters prior to Barnard&nbsp;did not encounter NGC 281 because it&nbsp;lies outside the comet “haystack” – that&nbsp;region of sky (within 60</span><span class="font2"><sup>◦</sup> </span><span class="font19">of the Sun) where&nbsp;comets are most likely to be discovered by&nbsp;visual observers using small telescopes. But&nbsp;Barnard did not follow the adopted routine&nbsp;of his predecessors; he believed the entire&nbsp;sky was the comet seeker's domain. The&nbsp;comet seeker, he said, “must examine every&nbsp;portion of [the sky] time and again...Every-thing is interesting and numberless objects&nbsp;are beautiful in the extreme. There is nothing commonplace in the sky.”</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Seeing the ghostly form of NGC 281 among the rich stellar folds of the Cassiopeia&nbsp;Milky Way must have bordered on the spiritual for Barnard, a man of strong religious&nbsp;conviction. Of all things, Barnard was especially fond of the Milky Way, the “jewel house&nbsp;of the Maker.” When we sweep there, he&nbsp;said, “our soul mounts up, up to that wonderful Creator, and we adore the hand that&nbsp;scattered the jewels of heaven so lavishly in&nbsp;this one vast region. No pen, can describe&nbsp;the wonderful scene that the swinging tube&nbsp;reveals as it sweeps among that vast starry&nbsp;array of suns.” Yes, NGC 281 was a financial&nbsp;disappointment, but how hard is it to imagine that the discovery of this object in this&nbsp;man's most revered corridor of the heavens&nbsp;would be anything but spiritually uplifting.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Who would blame Barnard for having such feelings?

These dense knots of dust and gas are&nbsp;the black pools into which we peer helplessly, to dream our dreams of creation, for&nbsp;these are the secret birth sites of new stars.&nbsp;How Barnard's heart would have fluttered&nbsp;had he lived to see such an image.

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Today, we know NGC 281 is an emission nebula – a vast cloud of ionized hydrogen&nbsp;obscuring clouds are actually part of a&nbsp;larger complex of atomic and molecular&nbsp;clouds forming an 880-light-year-wide ring&nbsp;around NGC 281, which is expanding away&nbsp;from the nebula at 22 kilometers per second. The entire complex was probably first&nbsp;formed by supernovae explosions, which&nbsp;triggered subsequent episodes of star formation, including those ongoing today.</p>

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;">lying back in my car seat, with my head resting comfortably against the headrest,&nbsp;and my eyes looking out an&nbsp;open window, best alleviated&nbsp;any eye strain.

IC 1590 has 63 probable&nbsp;members within its tiny disk, and Brent A.&nbsp;Archinal suspects many more stars in the&nbsp;nebula may be associated with the cluster.</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Guillaume Bigourdan's (1899–1917) discovery of IC 1590 was no less of an achievement than Barnard's. It takes a certain visual perspicacity to go beyond what one&nbsp;is expected to see (a nebula) and to find&nbsp;something new within it. Bigourdan was a&nbsp;highly esteemed visual observer. He found&nbsp;about 100 new nebulae and clusters with&nbsp;the 12-inch refractor at Paris Observatory,&nbsp;France, and IC 1590 was one of them. Of it,&nbsp;he writes, “In the region of NGC 281, there&nbsp;is in addition to the nebulosity suspected&nbsp;near BD <span class="font5">+</span><span class="font19">55</span><span class="font2"><sup>◦</sup> </span><span class="font19">191</span><span class="font2"><sup>^</sup> </span><span class="font19">, a large number of stars&nbsp;forming a very large cluster, without con-centration.”HalCorwin(CaliforniaInstitute&nbsp;of Technology) notes that Bigourdan's position of the cluster is about 3</span><span class="font2"><sup>^</sup> </span><span class="font19">southeast of the&nbsp;obvious group of stars taken to be IC 1590.&nbsp;“Without better evidence from Bigourdan's&nbsp;published material,” Corwin says “there is&nbsp;not much point intrying too hard to find this&nbsp;object. It sits in the middle of a large region&nbsp;of star formation, and any position we take&nbsp;in the area will get us some hot, young stars.”</span></p></td></tr></table><hr>

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">As for the nebula, well, “All I can say is thatIhave...seen it under all atmospheric&nbsp;conditions, at every hour of the...night,&nbsp;and I have never failed to be thrilled with&nbsp;its beauty and romance. What romance.” A&nbsp;distant relative of mine, Lieutenant-Colonel&nbsp;E. J. O'Meara, penned these words in his&nbsp;1935 autobiography <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">I'd Live It Again</span><span class="font19">; he's&nbsp;not describing NGC 281 but the Taj Mahal&nbsp;around 1912. Yet these same words capture&nbsp;the very wonderment I feel whenever I look&nbsp;at NGC 281, whose ghostly white “edifice”&nbsp;is bejeweled with stellar gems.</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">At 23<span class="font5">× </span><span class="font19">the glow is immediately apparent, even with light from a near first-quarter Moon in the sky. The first thing I notice is&nbsp;a nebula, like breath on a mirror, forming&nbsp;a concentric circular glow around the 9th-magnitude star at the heart of IC 1590. But&nbsp;with a gentle tap of the telescope tube, butterfly wings of ever so slightly denser material can be seen extending east–west of HD&nbsp;5005. A closer look reveals that the eastern&nbsp;wing is a tad brighter than the western wing,&nbsp;which is also slightly larger. A fainter extension of light, like a comet's dim dust tail,&nbsp;extends to the south-southwest and terminates near a magnitude 9.4 star (</span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">c</span><span class="font19">).</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Take time to relax your gaze and view the nebula with averted vision. It should,&nbsp;over time, transform NGC 281 from a uniform glow, to one with a discrete dappled&nbsp;texture. The nebula is enchanting, and the</p></td>

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;">longer you look the more you should see. But be warned, the details are fleeting. For&nbsp;instance, once my eye catches a patch of&nbsp;nebulosity with averted vision, it tries to&nbsp;snatch a glimpse of it with direct vision.&nbsp;Just then, my averted vision picks up a different patch of nebulosity, and the process&nbsp;repeats itself. That's the frustrating consequence of trying to see subtle details separated by equally subtle deviations in brightness. Seeing the nebula in this way is like&nbsp;taking a walk across a mysterious isle of&nbsp;light and shadow, a place where mist and fog&nbsp;weave back and forth like restless spirits. It&nbsp;is reminiscent of how the star detective of&nbsp;Carolyn Keene's popular Nancy Drew mystery stories imagined the Grand Isle – the&nbsp;haunt of the famous pirate Lafitte and his&nbsp;men. “[A]ccording to tradition,” Drew says&nbsp;to her friends in <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">The Ghost of Blackwood&nbsp;Hall</span><span class="font19">, “when burying treasure, he always&nbsp;murdered one of his band and left his ghost&nbsp;to guard the hidden loot.” With every sweep&nbsp;of the eye, Ifeelas though I'm being taunted&nbsp;by these bothersome spirits.</span></p></td></tr></table><hr>

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">With moderate and high powers, the densest regions of the nebula's core remain&nbsp;visible, while the remainder fades away.&nbsp;Look for a channel of darkness 2<span class="font2"><sup>^</sup> </span><span class="font19">northeast&nbsp;of HD 5005 – between it and two 10th-magnitude suns (</span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">e</span><span class="font19"> and </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">f</span><span class="font19"> ). A curved spit&nbsp;of bright nebulosity slices through two&nbsp;stars. Another dark channel, concentric&nbsp;with the previous one, lies between the spit&nbsp;just mentioned and another, fainter, spit&nbsp;equidistant to the northeast. These ripples&nbsp;of light and dark are reminiscent of those&nbsp;seen at the heart of the M8, the famous&nbsp;Lagoon Nebula, and look like shock waves&nbsp;pushing through the dim gas.</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">One “buried” treasure appears as a tight “nebulous” knot about 5<span class="font2"><sup>^</sup> </span><span class="font19">north-northeastof&nbsp;IC 1590 (</span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">d</span><span class="font19">). This glow is not a nebula but a&nbsp;tight clustering of about a dozen faint suns –&nbsp;too faint to be resolved with any confidence&nbsp;in the 4-inch. In agreement with Corwin, it's&nbsp;difficult to follow or judge the size or extent&nbsp;of IC 1590 because there appear to be many&nbsp;spots (like </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">d</span><span class="font19"> ), namely mini-clusterings –&nbsp;tight knots of dim stars within a larger concentration of brighter suns.

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">The nebula's largest and most prominent dark cloud of gas – a dense wedge of matter&nbsp;covering the southwest quadrant of the nebula in photographs – is conspicuous only in&nbsp;photographs of that region. It is the photographic appearance that gives rise to the&nbsp;nebula's popular nickname: the “Pacman&nbsp;Nebula,” honoring a video-game icon first&nbsp;introduced in 1980, more than a quartercentury ago. Although the dark nebula itself&nbsp;is not seen projected against bright nebulosity in the 4-inch, it is indirectly conspicuous&nbsp;by creating the opening that forms Pacman's&nbsp;mouth.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">If we accept NGC 281's distance as 9,400 light-years, the nebula measures 96 <span class="font5">× </span><span class="font19">82&nbsp;light-years; IC 1590 in comparison, spans&nbsp;17 light-years across.

If NGC 281 were at the distance of the Orion Nebula, it would be nearly&nbsp;2.5 times larger than that impressive gallery&nbsp;of glows and be second only to the Great Eta&nbsp;Carinae Nebula (Caldwell 92), the original&nbsp;celestial Taj Mahal, in apparent splendor.</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Before you move away from this region, do not overlook its other “hidden treasure,” Eta&nbsp;Cas. William Herschel discovered this glorious double star in August 1779. It carries a&nbsp;most delightful nickname: the “Easter Egg&nbsp;Double.” The magnitude 3.5 primary (type&nbsp;<span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">G</span><span class="font19">0V ) and magnitude 7.4 secondary (type&nbsp;</span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">dM</span><span class="font19">0) are separated by 13</span><span class="font2"><sup>^^</sup> </span><span class="font19">(2003).

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">In my antique telescope, the cluster is a little ball of “gas” with a slightly condensed&nbsp;core. Averted vision reveals&nbsp;a slight granular texture. The&nbsp;cluster comes to life in the&nbsp;4-inch.

Like&nbsp;that more northerly globular, NGC 288 does not have&nbsp;a strong central condensation, which is interesting&nbsp;since William Herschel lists&nbsp;it under his Class VI objects&nbsp;(very compressed and rich&nbsp;clusters of stars). At least in a 4-inch telescope, NGC 288's core appears to be a large&nbsp;mottled region, perhaps 6</span><span class="font2"><sup>^</sup> </span><span class="font19">across, whose&nbsp;overall brightness is greater than its equally&nbsp;large halo of dim suns.

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">What should be immediately apparent at high power is the core's boxy shape.&nbsp;This feature also shows up well in shortexposure photographs of the cluster. The&nbsp;details in this region can be grouped into&nbsp;three categories: (1) a faint blanket of similarly bright suns that forms a soft backdrop&nbsp;to (2); (2) several distinct strings of brighter&nbsp;stars whose overall arrangement gives the&nbsp;cluster its boxy shape; (3) a cluster marred&nbsp;bydarklanesandvoids.Oneprominentdark&nbsp;lane curves around a squashed apostrophe&nbsp;of stars just south of the cluster's vacant core,&nbsp;while two rectangular vacancies can be seen&nbsp;just north of it.

The strings of&nbsp;stars rimming the two dark bays to the north&nbsp;form a fine Omega (</span><span class="font5">^</span><span class="font19">) pattern with north&nbsp;up. In larger telescopes, the cluster is quite&nbsp;remarkable.

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">If we accept NGC 288's distance to be 27,500 light-years from the Sun, its true&nbsp;physical diameter then is 104 light-years&nbsp;across. The cluster is in an oddball retrograde orbit traveling at a speed of about 305&nbsp;kilometers per second some 39,000 light-years from the Milky Way's center.

That's about the same&nbsp;abundance that each cluster member has in&nbsp;globular cluster NGC 1851 in Columba – a&nbsp;galactic veteran of 14 billion years. How old&nbsp;is NGC 288? Well, that has been the matter&nbsp;of debate for many years. Some researchers&nbsp;claimed it was the same ageas another aged&nbsp;globular – NGC 362 in Tucana. Others found&nbsp;a significant discrepancy in the two clusters' ages. The most recent findings, however have shown that NGC 288 is some 2&nbsp;billion years older than NGC 362, making&nbsp;it about 13 to 14 billion years old, which&nbsp;places it among the very oldest globular&nbsp;clusters.</span></p></td>
<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">If such bickering seems inconsequential, it's not! Age battles in the galactic halo are of&nbsp;vast importance to astronomers. Knowing&nbsp;the age of globular clusters in the halo sets&nbsp;time constraints for the origin of the halo&nbsp;andthestartofthecollapseofthegalaxy.The&nbsp;ageof the oldest globular star clusters is also&nbsp;arguably the best observational lower limit&nbsp;we have to the age of the universe, which,&nbsp;at the moment, is generally accepted to be&nbsp;about 13.7 billion years old.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">If you live in southern USA or at similar latitudes, there's a fantastic variable star 9 <span class="font17"><sub>2</sub><sup>1 </sup></span><span class="font2"><sup>◦</sup> </span><span class="font19">to the southeast of NGC 288 where&nbsp;you'll find the scarlet carbon star R Sculptoris. The American Association of Variable Star Observers (AAVSO) has it ranging between magnitude 9.1 and 12.8 (photographic) every 370 days, while Australia's&nbsp;Canberra Astronomical Society has it ranging between magnitude 5.8 and 7.7 (visual)&nbsp;every 370 days. Regardless, the star is a&nbsp;scarlet wonder and a must see. Interestingly, another red variable, S Sculptoris lies&nbsp;about 10</span><span class="font2"><sup>◦</sup> </span><span class="font19">to the southwest of NGC 288; it&nbsp;varies from magnitude 5.5 to 13.6 every 365&nbsp;days, making it a perfect year-long observing project. Monitoring long-period variables is the best way for beginners to hone&nbsp;their skills at making magnitude estimates,&nbsp;since their periods and rates of variability&nbsp;are so well known that accurate predictions&nbsp;can be made. If you join a world-renowned&nbsp;organization like AAVSO, you can compare&nbsp;your magnitude estimates each month with&nbsp;those of other members.</span></p></td></tr></table><hr><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"><img src="Hidden Treasures_files/Hidden Treasures-39.jpg" style="width:340pt;height:494pt;"/></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;">

Through large Earth-based telescopes&nbsp;NGC 404 appears to be a roundish spiral. Its&nbsp;small bulge contrasts well with a surrounding dust ring. In the nineteenth century, Ireland's Lord Rosse (William Parsons, Third&nbsp;Earl of Rosse) believed he had resolved NGC&nbsp;404 into individual stars with his 72-inch&nbsp;reflector – the Leviathan of Parsonstown.&nbsp;Was this an illusion?

In general, they&nbsp;rotate slowly and thus are&nbsp;not very flattened but prolate (like an American soccer&nbsp;ball) or triaxle.

As advances in telescope power and&nbsp;technology progress, astronomers will be&nbsp;able to probe deeper into elliptical galaxies, which are more complex creatures than&nbsp;we once believed. It still remains unclear&nbsp;whether lenticulars evolved from ellipticals&nbsp;or the other way around. One popular theory is that ellipticals evolve primarily due to&nbsp;galactic mergers.

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;">If there is one constellation admired by astronomical historians and&nbsp;naked-eye observers, but neglected by&nbsp;deep-sky observers, Aries, the Ram, is it.&nbsp;Messier lists no deep-sky objects in this&nbsp;small but visually quaint constellation. Nor&nbsp;do we find any in the Caldwell list. Yet Aries&nbsp;has a hidden treasure that is just as bright&nbsp;as M91, M98, and M99 in Coma Berenices,&nbsp;as well as M108 and M109 in Ursa Major.&nbsp;The question is how many have seen it?</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">NGC 772 is easy to overlook because it lies within an acute triangle of three extremely&nbsp;popular Messier wonders: M33 (the Great&nbsp;Triangulum Spiral), M74 (the famous Phantom Galaxy) in Pisces, and M45 (the&nbsp;wondrous Pleiades in Taurus). And while&nbsp;NGC 772 is nearly 3 <span class="font17"><sub>2</sub><sup>1</sup> </span><span class="font19">times more distant&nbsp;than M74, it is only </span><span class="font17"><sub>2</sub><sup>1</sup> </span><span class="font19">-magnitude fainter.

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;">satellites have very anomalous redshifts – roughly 10 times that of NGC 772.&nbsp;Thus, Halton Arp includes NGC 772&nbsp;in his <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Atlas of Peculiar Galaxies</span><span class="font19"> as Arp 78.&nbsp;“The latter two [dwarf companions],” Arp&nbsp;argues, “are further examples of small&nbsp;companion galaxies which have redshifts&nbsp;that do not correspond to the standard&nbsp;cosmological-velocity redshifts.”</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">NGC 770, on the other hand, appears to be at about the same distance as NGC 772, so it&nbsp;is most likely a true companion to the larger&nbsp;spiral system. It has a separation of only&nbsp;160,000 light-years from its larger companion, and its apparent size indicates an actual&nbsp;diameter of only about 40,000 light-years.&nbsp;NGC 772 is comparatively large indeed, having a true linear diameter of 208,000 light-years, making it roughly twice the diameter&nbsp;of our Milky Way Galaxy with a total luminosity of 80 billion Suns.

It is also&nbsp;one of the most attractive doubles in the&nbsp;region. Robert Hooke (1635–1702), a founding member of the Royal Society in England and, who, in 1664, made the earliest&nbsp;sighting of a dark spot on Jupiter (one that&nbsp;revealed the planet's true rotation), also discovered Gamma's duplicity while following&nbsp;the comet of that year: “I took notice that&nbsp;it consisted of two small stars very near&nbsp;together; a like instance to which I have not&nbsp;else met with in all the heavens.” Here are&nbsp;two magnitude 4.8 beacons separated by&nbsp;7.8</span><span class="font2"><sup>^^</sup></span><span class="font19">, looking like a car's headlights blazing&nbsp;forth on a dark highway.

The forked or double arm on the eastern side is very interesting and it appears to&nbsp;have been pulled out of its normal symmetry, Indeed, this frayed appearance is probably due to a gravitational interaction with&nbsp;an unseen companion – one that may lie&nbsp;behind the galaxy as seen from our vantage in space.

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Look closely at the photograph on p. 56 and you'll see that the galaxy's arms are&nbsp;freckled with bright clumps of starlight, as if&nbsp;thegalaxyhashives.That'sbecauseNGC908&nbsp;is a starburst galaxy, one that is undergoing&nbsp;a period of intense star formation – another&nbsp;indication that NGC 908 had a recent&nbsp;encounter with another object. Usually starburst galaxies can manufacture solar-mass&nbsp;stars at the phenomenal rate of hundreds of&nbsp;millions per year. At such a rate, the galaxy&nbsp;would have used up all its star-forming&nbsp;material on the order of 100 million years.&nbsp;Naturally, then, these starburst episodes&nbsp;must have occurred in the relatively recent&nbsp;past. Generally these episodes are confined to very luminous clusters around the&nbsp;galaxy's nucleus. They are the most dense&nbsp;and intense star-forming regions known.&nbsp;Other starburst galaxies include M82 in Ursa&nbsp;Major and the Ringtail galaxies NGC 4038–9&nbsp;(Caldwell 60 &amp; 61) in Corvus.</p>

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;">At a distance of 34 million light-years, NGC 1023 in Perseus is the&nbsp;nearest lenticular galaxy to the Milky Way. It&nbsp;is also the brightest of 40 galaxies belonging&nbsp;to the Triangulum Spur of galaxies, of which&nbsp;NGC 891 (Caldwell 23) in Andromeda is a&nbsp;member. But being the brightest does not&nbsp;mean being the largest. While NGC 1023&nbsp;is moderately sized, spanning 65,000 light-years in length, it is 40 percent smaller than&nbsp;NGC 891. The reason NGC 891 appears&nbsp;dimmer (albeit only slightly) than NGC 1023&nbsp;is because it is tilted a mere 6<span class="font2"><sup>◦</sup> </span><span class="font19">from edge-on.&nbsp;As a result, much of its luminous matter is&nbsp;obscured by dust, which runs perpendicular to the galaxy's mid plane.

Lenticulars are noted for&nbsp;their prominent central bulges, which are&nbsp;surrounded by a disk of luminous matter&nbsp;that lacks coherent spiral structure. In high-resolution images, the nucleus of NGC 1023&nbsp;appears to be in the center of a diffuse bar&nbsp;near the minor axis of the projected lens.&nbsp;Radio studies of the ionized hydrogen gas&nbsp;outside NGC 1023 suggest that the galaxy&nbsp;suffered a tidal interaction, sometime in the&nbsp;past, with one of its dwarf companions, the&nbsp;most obvious of which is an irregular system&nbsp;(NGC 1023A) to the east and slightly south&nbsp;of the major axis. The optical appearance&nbsp;of NGC 1023, however, is quite relaxed and&nbsp;shows no sign of that event.</p></td></tr></table><hr>

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Spectroscopic observations of the central parts of NGC 1023 with the 6-meter telescope of the Special Astrophysical Observatory, have revealed that the galaxy's stellar-like nucleus is substantially younger than&nbsp;its surrounding bulge: the mean age of the&nbsp;nuclear stellar populations is 7 billion years.&nbsp;As with NGC 891 and other spiral galaxies,&nbsp;including our own Milky Way, NGC 1023's&nbsp;rotational velocity is far greater than one&nbsp;would expect if the galaxy had no matter&nbsp;other than stars, gas, and dust – the implication being that the galaxy is embedded&nbsp;within a halo of dark matter that exerts gravitational forces but emits no measurable&nbsp;electromagnetic radiation. Hubble Space&nbsp;Telescope (HST) observations have shown&nbsp;the galaxy's nuclear region (out to a distance&nbsp;of about 16 light-years from the nucleus) to&nbsp;be rotating at about 70 kilometers per second. One explanation for such rapid core&nbsp;rotation is the presence of a supermassive&nbsp;black hole with an estimated mass of around&nbsp;40 million solar masses.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">A total of 11 globular clusters have been found in NGC 1023. Most appear similar&nbsp;to those of our own Milky Way; NGC 1023&nbsp;globulars are at least older than 5 billion&nbsp;years. NGC 1023's brightest globular cluster, recently studied by the HST, is much&nbsp;more compact than Omega Centauri (Caldwell 80) and has a linear diameter of 24 light-years – which is huge, especially if you consider that the nearest star toour Sun is only a&nbsp;little over 4 light-years away. It also contains&nbsp;an enhanced amount of cyanogen, which&nbsp;makes it similar to some of the globulars&nbsp;found within M31. In fact, it is most similar&nbsp;to G1 (Mayall II), the brightest globular cluster in M31. Unlike G1, NGC 1023's brightest&nbsp;globular appears to be very highly flattened&nbsp;with an ellipticity of about 0.37, which is&nbsp;similar to the most flattened globular clusters found in the Large Magellanic Cloud.</p></td>
<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">A new population of faint (23–24-magnitude) star clusters was also recently discovered in NGC 1023. They extend from&nbsp;22 to 49 light-years from the galaxy's center and are thought to be superclusters&nbsp;formed by the merging of various clusters.&nbsp;Such superclusters often form in interacting galaxies and have very large diameters&nbsp;exceeding 45 light-years. These objects are&nbsp;suffering from strong tidal forces, yet they&nbsp;are still able to survive.</p>

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">At high power, the galaxy becomes a very puzzling sight. The sharp center is surrounded by a bright lens of light, punctuated&nbsp;on the west, northwest, and east by nebulous knots or stars. Together these appear&nbsp;to form a broken ring around the nucleus.&nbsp;A long “bar” of light extends east along&nbsp;the galaxy's major axis. This too appears&nbsp;beaded, as if it were comprised of faint&nbsp;starlight. A similar “bar” or lane of brightness is equally prominent extending along&nbsp;the galaxy's major axis to the west. But these&nbsp;bars are obviously illusions created by a&nbsp;chance alignment of a few field stars along&nbsp;formed during a period of enhanced star&nbsp;formation, which was stimulated by a close&nbsp;encounter with NGC 1023. California amateur Jamie Dillon detected NGC 1023A in an&nbsp;11-inch f/4.5 Dobsonian at 420<span class="font5">×</span><span class="font19">;inan18-inch, he says it looks like a little “splotch” on&nbsp;the galaxy's eastern flank.</span></p></td>

To peer into the lens of light at the&nbsp;core of NGC 1232's swirling arms is to peer&nbsp;into a well of eternal questions: “The ways&nbsp;of God in Nature, as in Providence,” writes&nbsp;the Cambridge Platonist Joseph Glanville&nbsp;(1636–1680), “are not as <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">our</span><span class="font19"> ways; nor are&nbsp;the models that we frame any way commensurate to the vastness, profundity, and&nbsp;unsearchableness of His works, </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">which have&nbsp;a depth in them greater than the well of Democritus.</span><span class="font19">”</span></p></td></tr></table><hr>

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">NGC 1232 is a fantastic system, belonging to the equally fantastic Fornax Cluster and Eridanus Cloud of galaxies. In his <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Galaxies and the Universe,</span><span class="font19"> Gerard de Vau-couleurs notes that the Eridanus Cloud&nbsp;also includes the NGC 1209 and NGC 1332&nbsp;groups. The five brightest members of the&nbsp;Eridanus Group are NGC 1232, NGC 1398&nbsp;(Hidden Treasure 19), NGC 1187, NGC 1300,&nbsp;and NGC 1407. Our target has a linear diam-eterof131,000light-years,atotalmassof120&nbsp;billion Suns, and a total luminosity of some&nbsp;40 billion Suns. We see the system nearly&nbsp;face on, so its arms appear open and loose.&nbsp;Here we have the prototype of a multiplearmed spiral galaxy. Look at the photograph&nbsp;on p. 67. Note that the arms do not spiral out from the edge of a high-surface-brightness disk. Only two major arms begin&nbsp;at this rim. After about one-quarter revolution, each branches into two fragments,&nbsp;then,furtheron,branchagain.Thesystemis&nbsp;so loose that these branching fragments do&nbsp;not interact. Seen as a whole, almost every&nbsp;spiral form is crooked. The pattern resembles that of M101 but is slightly more regular.</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Note also the long row of suns, to the west, which is apparently formed by H-II&nbsp;regions. Indeed, all the arms are filled with&nbsp;H-II regions. Halton Arp lists NGC 1232 as&nbsp;the 41st object in his 1966 <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Atlas of Peculiar&nbsp;Galaxies</span><span class="font19">. Of it, he remarks: “Companion spiral wound in same sense as parent. Note&nbsp;split of companion's arm further into centre.” A barred spiral galaxy (NGC 1232A) lies&nbsp;4</span><span class="font2"><sup>^</sup> </span><span class="font19">to the east of NGC 1232; whether this is&nbsp;a true companion or a chance alignment is&nbsp;a matter of debate. Certainly, it too is highly&nbsp;resolved and displays distorted knotty arms.&nbsp;If it does lie at the same distance, then NGC&nbsp;1232A is separated from its larger companion by 134,000 light-years.</span></p></td>
<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">NGC 1232 and NGC 1232A are actually a central and pivotal part of Arp's redshift&nbsp;argument, which challenges the almost universally held belief that the large redshifts&nbsp;of quasars and other active galaxies are due&nbsp;to cosmic expansion. Arp's <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Atlas of Peculiar Galaxies</span><span class="font19"> contains photographs of 338&nbsp;peculiar galaxies that appear to be interacting or linked by bridges of luminous matter. If the frequency of discordant galaxies&nbsp;is greater than the statistics of chance projection allow, or if the bridges of matter are&nbsp;real, then there may be a need for new redshift models. Arp argues there is.</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">In the case of NGC 1232, Arp notes that the companion galaxy, which is near the&nbsp;end of one of NGC 1232's spiral arms, shows&nbsp;the same resolution of knots and features as&nbsp;the main galaxy. Inward from this companion, the arm splits, strangely into a channel about the width of the companion. Arp&nbsp;says this is evidence that the companion&nbsp;originated within the main spiral and traveled outward along the arm. The problem&nbsp;for conventional theorists is that the redshifts of NGC 1232 and NGC 1232A are discordant. The conventional theory therefore&nbsp;placesthecompanion,NGC1232A,atnearly&nbsp;four times the distance of the primary. How&nbsp;then, Arp argues, can the resolution of the&nbsp;two galaxies be the same? And, he says, is&nbsp;it <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">really</span><span class="font19"> a coincidence that the companion&nbsp;is located near the </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">end</span><span class="font19"> of a disturbed spiral&nbsp;arm?</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Another interesting anomaly is that almost opposite the companion, the arm&nbsp;of NGC 1232 exhibits a strange deformity&nbsp;or flattening. When Arp took a spectrum&nbsp;of the region he discovered a highly red-shifted object of over 28,000 kilometers per&nbsp;second (almost one-tenth the velocity of&nbsp;light) which far exceeds that of the main&nbsp;galaxy. This highly redshifted&nbsp;galaxy which Arp calls Galaxy&nbsp;B is extremely blue and cannot be any kind of normal&nbsp;galaxy. Is it really a mere coincidence that this highly red-shifted (background?) object&nbsp;is located precisely at the&nbsp;point where the arm is most&nbsp;highly disturbed?</p></td></tr></table><hr>
<table cellpadding="7pt">
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Arp also argues that at the distance of NGC 1232&nbsp;one does not see background&nbsp;galaxies through the disk of&nbsp;a spiral galaxy. The dust and&nbsp;obscuration in the disk of&nbsp;such spirals, particularly near&nbsp;the arms simply forms an&nbsp;impenetrable screen. If, however, by some&nbsp;miracle we could see a background object,&nbsp;it would have to be heavily reddened – yet&nbsp;this is a highly redshifted <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">blue</span><span class="font19"> object. All of&nbsp;this, he says, is strong evidence that all of the&nbsp;objectsdescribedareatornearthesamedis-tance from us, and the conventional redshift&nbsp;as a distance indicator is misleading.</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Alas, evidence is mounting to support the conventional theorists. So, at least for now,&nbsp;there is no need for new physical redshift&nbsp;models, though the debate continues.</p>

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Under a dark sky, the galaxy is more than an amorphous haze, if you give it time. <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Sky&nbsp;&amp; Telescope</span><span class="font19">'s late Deep-Sky Wonders columnist Walter Scott Houston, called it a “gem.”&nbsp;Interestingly, he had not heard of anyone&nbsp;seeing detailed structure in it with telescopes any smaller than 12 inches.

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">But the key to success in seeing detail in this visually challenging galaxy is to observe&nbsp;it in layers, using different magnifications. I&nbsp;agree, you will not see much in this galaxy&nbsp;with a quick look. You have to want to study&nbsp;it, and that requires time. I began my journey with 72<span class="font5">×</span><span class="font19">, which seemed to show best&nbsp;the galaxy's sharp, starlike core. I also got&nbsp;suggestions of spiral structure close to the&nbsp;central lens, curving to the southwest. Once&nbsp;you suspect some detail, take a rest, breath&nbsp;in some fresh air, then return to the telescope. Now use your averted vision and see&nbsp;if the “amorphous” haze does not start to&nbsp;splinter into all manner of enhancements&nbsp;across the galaxy's face. Don't worry about&nbsp;trying to pinpoint any of them. Just let them&nbsp;pop in and out of view.</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">When I put in 101<span class="font5">×</span><span class="font19">, a dim arm arcing to the southwest immediately snapped into&nbsp;view. Then, after a few minutes, this arm&nbsp;split into two distinct and parallel features.&nbsp;With averted vision and 168</span><span class="font5">×</span><span class="font19">, a few distinct&nbsp;stars or knots could be seen superimposed</span></p></td>

Then&nbsp;he switched to his left eye: “With the left&nbsp;eye I see it mottled. (N.B.

Weak dust lanes can also be seen&nbsp;in the bar, and they are organized in a clockwise spiral pattern – the same sense as in the&nbsp;outer spiral arms. The pattern of the dust is&nbsp;controlled by rotation. Interestingly, observations of the galaxy's molecular-hydrogen&nbsp;also reveal a large central hole, about twice&nbsp;as large as the central bar. But such holes&nbsp;are common to these systems, whose rotating bars can channel gas and dust into the&nbsp;center of the galaxy and trigger bursts of&nbsp;star formation. Winds driven by supernovae&nbsp;explosions or massive star formation could&nbsp;also clear the inner regions of molecular-hydrogen gas.</span></p></td>

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Recent X-ray data confirm that the interstellar medium in the bulge of NGC 1291 is dominated by hot gas. It seems that within&nbsp;the morphological class Sa, there can be significant differences in the gas content of the&nbsp;bulge, with the more massive bulges being&nbsp;likely to contain the hot gas. Since NGC 1291&nbsp;is a bulge-dominated Sa galaxy, this scenario fits nicely. The source of X-ray emission appears to bethe galaxy's central point-likenucleusandsome50additionalsources,&nbsp;which may below mass X-ray binaries. NGC&nbsp;1291 is a galaxy that is obviously still forming and therefore typical of morphological&nbsp;Sa-type galaxies.</p>

At&nbsp;23</span><span class="font5">× </span><span class="font19">in the 4-inch, the galaxy shows a sharp&nbsp;inner core surrounded by a bright elliptical lens, which is itself wrapped in a circular halo of faint light.

But the reason for the NGC description becomes obvious when the galaxy is&nbsp;studied at higher powers. That's when several dim stars or knots can be seen superimposed on this globular glow. Hartung concurs, writing that this “extra-galactic system&nbsp;looks not unlike a distant unresolved globular cluster; the edges diffuse away gradually&nbsp;to about 2</span><span class="font2"><sup>^</sup> </span><span class="font19">diameter with a small very bright&nbsp;central region which shows a strong prism&nbsp;band. It is easy for small apertures.” Thus,&nbsp;the fact that James Dunlop and John Herschel both recorded this object as a globular&nbsp;is no mystery.</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">At 101<span class="font5">× </span><span class="font19">in the 4-inch, the starlike core sits inside a circular annulus of bright light,&nbsp;which is surrounded by a large diffuse lens.&nbsp;Both the inner ring and lens appear mottled.

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">If you want a challenge, try looking for the two broad arcs of light, which line the&nbsp;ansae of the inner lens. Finer enhancements appear and disappear all around&nbsp;the circumference; what I see depends on&nbsp;where I focus my attention with averted&nbsp;vision. The great Italian astronomer Angelo&nbsp;Secchi (1818–1878) described a similar&nbsp;phenomenon while observing M57, the&nbsp;Ring Nebula in Lyra. Secchi believed he&nbsp;resolved the ring into minute stars “glittering like stardust.” In the case of NGC 1291,&nbsp;however, the phenomenon is most likely&nbsp;due to the fact that dim field stars pepper&nbsp;the face of the galaxy. It's more like looking at snowflakes falling on a fur collar; as&nbsp;soon as one snowflake lands, it quickly dissolves, only to be replaced with yet another&nbsp;snowflake.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Before moving on, return your thoughts to Theta Eri. It's not widely known, but&nbsp;the nineteenth-century Scottish clergyman&nbsp;and amateur astronomer Thomas David&nbsp;Anderson – who discovered a nova in Auriga&nbsp;in 1892, and one in Perseus in 1901 – argued&nbsp;that Theta Eri had dimmed over the centuries, since it was listed by Ptolemy and Al-Sufi as being of the first magnitude; Anderson's arguments appear in the 1893 issue of&nbsp;<span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge.</span></p></td></tr></table><hr><img src="Hidden Treasures_files/Hidden Treasures-75.jpg" style="width:389pt;height:488pt;"/>

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;">ngc 1316 is the brightest and most peculiar member of the Fornax Cluster of galaxies. This peculiar elliptical or&nbsp;lenticular galaxy is the well-known radio&nbsp;source Fornax A, one of the closest and&nbsp;most famous sources in the Southern&nbsp;Hemisphere. The morphology of NGC 1316&nbsp;resembles NGC 5128 in Centaurus (Caldwell 77), which is also identified with a&nbsp;strong radio source: Centaurus A. Indeed,&nbsp;NGC 1316 has radio lobes extending over&nbsp;several degrees of sky. And like NGC 5128,&nbsp;NGC 1316 has a large bulge, a system of&nbsp;dust filaments across the minor axis with&nbsp;spiral segments, ripples, and loops in its&nbsp;outer shell – all tidal signatures of a merger.</p></td>
<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Indeed, NASA's Hubble Space Telescope (HST) has found evidence for such a merger,&nbsp;or mergers.

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;">the message seemed clear: sometime during the last 100 million years, NGC 1316 collided&nbsp;with and swallowed a gas-rich companion&nbsp;galaxy.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Wide-field imagery from Cerro Tololo Interamerican Observatory in Chile corroborates thistheory.The images show a bewildering variety of ripples, loops, and plumes&nbsp;immersed in the galaxy's outer envelope –&nbsp;again, all tidal signatures ofa merger. In fact,&nbsp;the narrowest loops are believed to be the&nbsp;stellar remains of other spiral galaxies that&nbsp;merged with NGC 1316 some time during&nbsp;the last few billion years.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">And there's more evidence. In 1999 Carl Grillmair (California Institute of Technology) and his colleagues, used HST to study&nbsp;NGC 1316 and found surprisingly few glob-ulars around it. Instead, they discovered a&nbsp;large population of old and relatively dim&nbsp;star clusters, which contain onlya few thousand stars each. The results took Grillmair&nbsp;and his team by surprise. Usually, when&nbsp;galaxies merge, the resulting clusters are&nbsp;very bright, very blue, and very young. But&nbsp;the star clusters detected in NGC 1316 are&nbsp;too old to have been born during the collision that produced the dusty debris seen in&nbsp;the HST image, Grillmair says. “[T]hey have&nbsp;not been around long enough to have been&nbsp;torn apart by galactic tidal forces.” It's possible that the dim, old clusters are the remains&nbsp;of an earlier collision.</p></td>
<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">But in 2003, a US team of scientists, led by Dr. Paul Goudfrooij of the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, Maryland, did a follow-up study with a more sensitive camera. For the first time, his team&nbsp;saw evidence of the gradual disruption of&nbsp;star clusters created during a past merger.&nbsp;They found that the relative number of low-mass clusters is significantly lower in the&nbsp;inner regions than in the outer regions, by an&nbsp;amount consistent with theoretical predictions. The team's results have improved our&nbsp;understanding of how elliptical galaxies and&nbsp;their star clusters may have formed during&nbsp;galaxy mergers and then evolve to resemble “normal” elliptical galaxies after several&nbsp;billions of years.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">AsforthesourceofNGC1316'sradioemis-sions, they could be generated by a massive black hole lying at the center of this massive galaxy, which spans 84,000 light-years of space and has a total luminosity&nbsp;of some 60 billion Suns. The opposing jets&nbsp;in the radio data extend out about 16,000&nbsp;light-years before abruptly terminating. The&nbsp;inner 1,000 light-years of the jets contain&nbsp;discreet knots while the outer parts are&nbsp;continuous, which indicates strong interactions with the surrounding medium. The&nbsp;lobes' radio emitting electrons have a lifetime of perhaps 100 million years. If so,&nbsp;then the nucleus was particularly active at&nbsp;least 100 million years ago. At present, however, the nucleus is very faint in X-ray emissions, which is a good indicator that activity&nbsp;has either decreased markedly or become</p></td></tr></table><hr>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;">dormant. This also suggests the possible abundance of&nbsp;dormant quasars in nearby&nbsp;galaxies, if quasars are&nbsp;thought to be the central hot&nbsp;spots of very active galactic&nbsp;nuclei.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">James Dunlop discovered this fantastic system on&nbsp;September 2, 1826. He, of&nbsp;course, was totally unaware&nbsp;of the drama unfolding&nbsp;before his eyes.

But the tide turned when&nbsp;youthful Perseus flew down to her on winged&nbsp;sandals. Perseus nearly mistook her pure&nbsp;white form for marble, except that he&nbsp;noticed her flaxen hair blowing in the gentle breeze, and&nbsp;her brilliant eyes welling with&nbsp;tears.</p></td></tr></table><hr>

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:9pt;">“O virgin, undeserving of those chains, but rather of&nbsp;such as bind fond lovers&nbsp;together,” Perseus said, “tell&nbsp;me, I beseech you, your&nbsp;name, and the name of your&nbsp;country,andwhyyouarethus&nbsp;bound.”</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:9pt;">As the hero listened to Andromeda's woeful tale, his&nbsp;muscles tensed. The youth&nbsp;was already feeling quite the champion,&nbsp;because he had just slain the gorgon&nbsp;Medusa, whose gruesome head (with those&nbsp;I'll-turn-you-to-stone eyes) he had in a&nbsp;leather sack. Perseus whispered some words&nbsp;of hope to Andromeda. The enterprising&nbsp;young man also made her a bargain: if he&nbsp;slayed this beast, she would be his bride.&nbsp;Andromeda agreed and sealed the promise&nbsp;with a kiss.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:9pt;padding:0pt 0pt 14pt 0pt;">In his 1856 book, <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">The Heroes,</span><span class="font19"> Charles Kingsley continues the story in a most illustrious fashion:</span></p>
<p class="font18" style="text-align:justify;padding:0pt 0pt 0pt 9pt;">Perseus laughed for joy, and flew upward, while Andromeda crouched trembling on the rock,&nbsp;waiting for what might befall.</p>

<p class="font18" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:8pt;padding:0pt 0pt 0pt 9pt;">At last he saw Andromeda, and shot forward to take his prey, while the waves foamed white&nbsp;behind him, and before him the fish fled&nbsp;leaping.</p></td>

<p class="font18" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:8pt;padding:0pt 0pt 0pt 9pt;">Then down from the height of the air fell Perseus like a shooting star; down to the crests&nbsp;of the waves, while Andromeda hid her face as&nbsp;he shouted; and then there was silence for a&nbsp;while.</p>
<p class="font18" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:8pt;padding:0pt 0pt 8pt 9pt;">At last she looked up trembling, and saw Perseus springing toward her; and, instead of&nbsp;the monster a long, black rock, with the sea rippling quietly about it.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;">Perseus had held the blood-freezing head of Medusa before the monster and turned it to&nbsp;stone. The storyhasa rare happy ending: the&nbsp;gorgon and the sea monster are slain, the&nbsp;beautiful maiden is saved by a handsome&nbsp;hero, and the lovers marry. They become the&nbsp;great grandparents of yet another hero – the&nbsp;mighty Hercules.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:9pt;">Perseus is unmistakable in the night sky. The core of the constellation is a prominent spine of bright suns known as the Segment of Perseus. This graceful arc follows “a&nbsp;very brilliant part of the Via Lactea [(Milky&nbsp;Way)],” as Adm. Smyth wrote. The brightest part of the Segment measures about 12<span class="font2"><sup>◦&nbsp;</sup></span><span class="font19">in length and consists of the stars Eta (</span><span class="font5">^</span><span class="font19">),&nbsp;Gamma (</span><span class="font5">^ </span><span class="font19">), Alpha (</span><span class="font5">^</span><span class="font19">), Sigma (</span><span class="font5">^</span><span class="font19">), Phi (</span><span class="font5">^</span><span class="font19">),&nbsp;and Delta (</span><span class="font5">^</span><span class="font19">) Persei.

<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">The brightest star in the Segment, and in the constellation, is Alpha Per. Its classical&nbsp;name, Mirfak, Mirphak, or Marfak, means&nbsp;Elbow. It derives from the Arabic <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Marfik al&nbsp;Thurayya</span><span class="font19"> (Elbow Nearest the Many Little&nbsp;Ones). While </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">al Thurayya</span><span class="font19"> is the descriptive&nbsp;Arabic word for the Pleiades, it makes little sense. Even if we concede that the Arabs&nbsp;could have depicted Perseus differently in&nbsp;their day, it is hard to imagine Alpha as&nbsp;an elbow </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">near</span><span class="font19"> the Pleiades, which is some&nbsp;25</span><span class="font2"><sup>◦</sup> </span><span class="font19">to the south-southeast. It is instead my&nbsp;belief that the Arabian word </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">al Thurayya&nbsp;</span><span class="font19">was, at least in this case, referring to the&nbsp;“little ones” near Alpha Persei. That early&nbsp;Arabian skywatchers, at times, gave different stars the same name is a known fact.&nbsp;The name Meissa (Lambda [</span><span class="font5">^</span><span class="font19">] Orionis), for&nbsp;instance derives from the Arabic </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Al-Maisan&nbsp;</span><span class="font19">(The Proudly Marching One, or The Shining&nbsp;One). But the Arabs first gave that name to&nbsp;Gamma (</span><span class="font5">^ </span><span class="font19">) Geminorum (see Hidden Treasure 29). Indeed, the fourth-century Arabian lexicographer Al Firuzabadi believed&nbsp;the title </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Al-Maisan</span><span class="font19"> could be applied to any&nbsp;bright star. It is more believable, then, and&nbsp;perhaps more illuminating, to think that&nbsp;the Arab skywatchers of old were arguably&nbsp;the first to see the glittering gems associated with the Alpha Persei Moving Cluster –&nbsp;a large scattered cluster of stars whose&nbsp;brightest members lie between Alpha and&nbsp;Delta Persei, the very heart of the famous&nbsp;Segment.</span></p></td>
<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Like the majority of bright stars in Taurus, Orion, and Ursa Major, those in Perseus, are&nbsp;part of a true physical system. In 1910 Arthur&nbsp;Eddington first described it as a widespread&nbsp;moving cluster and P. J. Melotte cataloged it&nbsp;in 1915. In 1930 Harvard astronomer Harlow&nbsp;Shapley wrote that while the group might&nbsp;be placed in the class of “very loose and&nbsp;irregular clusters” typified by the Hyades, he&nbsp;thought it better placed with the Orion Nebula cluster in the class of “starassociations,”&nbsp;or widespread moving clusters, such as the&nbsp;Ursa Major group.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Today we know the cluster consists of some 50 stars splashed across 47 light-years of space. About a dozen of these&nbsp;suns are within 2<span class="font2"><sup>◦</sup> </span><span class="font19">of Alpha Per and shine&nbsp;at magnitude 6 or brighter. So, as with&nbsp;the Pleiades, the region appears luminous&nbsp;with direct vision and resolved with averted&nbsp;vision. The Italian astronomer Giovanni&nbsp;Batista Hodierna (1597–1660) first logged&nbsp;these stars as a “nebulous” object in his&nbsp;</span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">De Admirandi Coeli Caracteribus</span><span class="font19"> of 1654&nbsp;(which is mainly why I include it in the </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Hidden Treasures</span><span class="font19"> list.) He described its appearance through a simple Galilean refractor at&nbsp;20 </span><span class="font5">×</span><span class="font19">: “[It] shines on the right side of Perseus&nbsp;near the Milky Way, where, next to a star of&nbsp;high luminosity (which is also shining from&nbsp;the same side), there is also a certain nebulosity.”</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">A look at this region today in even the smallest of binoculars is one of abject wonder. In his <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Astronomy with an Opera-Glass&nbsp;</span><span class="font19">(1923), Garrett Serviss called the field one of&nbsp;the finest in the sky, with “[s]tars conspicuously ranged in curving lines and streams. A&nbsp;host follows Alpha from the east and south.”&nbsp;In7 </span><span class="font5">× </span><span class="font19">50 binoculars from Hawaii, the cluster&nbsp;has an exquisite serpentine body, one befitting of the sea monster that mythical Perseus&nbsp;had turned to stone. Seen with southwest&nbsp;“up,” the beast's hideous head is a conspicuous 1</span><span class="font2"><sup>◦</sup> </span><span class="font19">-wide circlet of 6th-magnitude&nbsp;suns with Alpha Per marking its gaping jaws.</span></p></td></tr></table><hr><div style="float:left;layout-flow:horizontal;"><img src="Hidden Treasures_files/Hidden Treasures-83.jpg" style="width:256pt;height:304pt;"/></div>

And in 2003, John R. Stauffer&nbsp;(California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA) and his colleagues identified&nbsp;27 brown dwarf candidates. If these stars&nbsp;are cluster members they have masses less&nbsp;than 0.1 Sun. A 1992 study by Charles Prosser&nbsp;(Lick Observatory) of 132 low-mass members, suggests an age of about 80 million&nbsp;years, making it about the same age as the&nbsp;Pleiades.</span></p></td>

Countless hundreds of dim suns form all manner of&nbsp;geometrical patterns: loops, arcs, hooks,&nbsp;lines, angles, and other miniature asterisms.

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;">ngc 1333 is a simple but beautiful reflection nebula, and a highly&nbsp;active star-formation region, within the&nbsp;Perseus molecular cloud complex. It lies 3<span class="font17"><sup>1</sup><sub>4</sub></span><span class="font2"><sup>◦&nbsp;</sup></span><span class="font19">southwest of Omicron (o) Persei and almost&nbsp;nicks the spot where Perseus, Taurus, and&nbsp;Aries meet. At magnitude 5.7 the nebula is&nbsp;quite bright, but it's also very tiny. It belongs&nbsp;to a class of nebulae, which I call “dwarf&nbsp;nebulae” – reflection, emission, or dark,&nbsp;nebulae that have apparent diameters 10</span><span class="font2"><sup>^&nbsp;</sup></span><span class="font19">or smaller.</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">On most star charts, the object is far from eye-catching. In the second edition of&nbsp;Tirion's <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Sky Atlas 2000.0</span><span class="font19">, for instance, the&nbsp;symbol for NGC 1333 is a tiny box no bigger&nbsp;than the disk representing a 4th-magnitude&nbsp;star. The box looks like an afterthought, perhaps a move to flesh out that region of&nbsp;sky with pretty symbols. Certainly observers&nbsp;moving their fingers across their star charts&nbsp;while selecting objects for a night's work&nbsp;would not stop there.

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">If you find it hard to believe that this tiny nebula can be seen in a small telescope, consider this: Eduard Scho¨ nfeld discovered NGC 1333 in 1858 with the 3.1-inch&nbsp;Fraunhofer comet seeker at Bonn Observatory in Germany.

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Independent discoveries continue to this day. For instance, when Paul Clark (North&nbsp;Wales, UK) came across the object with his&nbsp;5 <span class="font17"><sub>2</sub><sup>1</sup> </span><span class="font19">-inch Orion Maksutov telescope, he said,&nbsp;that at first, “I thought I'd found a comet.&nbsp;A bright oval coma with dense nebulosity&nbsp;hiding a star as the nucleus.” I am no excep-tion.SeveraltimesIhavesweptupNGC1333&nbsp;during my comet hunts (even in moonlight)&nbsp;with the 4-inch refractor.

Allen's comment only demonstrates an&nbsp;awesome truth, namely that some objects&nbsp;are just not well suited for extreme apertures and high magnifications. This fact&nbsp;might also explain why William Herschel&nbsp;missed NGC 1333 in his great sky survey.&nbsp;(Remember this whenever you hear some&nbsp;observer shout, “You couldn't possibly have&nbsp;seen such and such, because </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">I</span><span class="font19"> couldn't see&nbsp;it in my monster telescope.”)</span></p></td>
<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Allen's comment reminds me of some observations William Sheehan and I made&nbsp;of M57, the famous Ring Nebula in Lyra,&nbsp;with two different 40-inch telescopes. In&nbsp;July 1992, we were using the 40-inch reflector atop Pic du Midi in the French Pyrenees&nbsp;to study Mars. One night, for a change, we&nbsp;turned the telescope to M57. While the Ring&nbsp;was fantastically obvious inthe finderscope,&nbsp;we were surprised to see only two stars centered in the eyepiece of the main telescope.&nbsp;It turned out that, at 1,200<span class="font5">×</span><span class="font19">, we were looking at the area of sky </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">inside</span><span class="font19"> the Ring; the two&nbsp;stars wesaw weretheplanetary's central star&nbsp;and its similarly bright companion to the&nbsp;northwest. When we slewed the telescope to&nbsp;look at the nebula, we were again surprised&nbsp;at how pale and ill-defined it looked. This&nbsp;observation stood in stark contrast to a low-power view we had of it with the 40-inch&nbsp;reflector at Lick Observatory several years&nbsp;later, when the Ring was an intensely bright&nbsp;vortex with a pearly luster. We could not&nbsp;see the central star nor its companion at&nbsp;such a low magnification because the Ring's&nbsp;central region was filled with luminous gas.&nbsp;Large telescopes – especially the older models that, because of their long focal lengths,&nbsp;cannot offer decent low-power views of&nbsp;deep-sky objects – cannot perform well&nbsp;on “large” and diffuse nebulae, especially&nbsp;when the atmosphere is not stable.</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">To find this interesting object, first locate 3rd-magnitude Zeta (<span class="font5">^ </span><span class="font19">) Persei about 8</span><span class="font2"><sup>◦&nbsp;</sup></span><span class="font19">north-northwest of the Pleiades.

After making several&nbsp;observations of the nebula over the years,&nbsp;I find it much more complex than I had&nbsp;first imagined. Three fainter “diamonds”&nbsp;mark the tiara's head band.

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Hal Corwin (California Technical Institute) notes that early observations of NGC 1333 led some to believe that the nebula varied in brightness. “[The] observations with&nbsp;smalltelescopeswerecontradictoryenough&nbsp;to lead to suggestions that it might be variable,” Corwin explains. This perception was&nbsp;exacerbated by Tuttle's discovery observation, in which he inverted the field directions. Interestingly, part of the object seems&nbsp;to be a collapsing protostar. If the density&nbsp;and position of dust clouds surrounding&nbsp;the protostar in NGC 1333 are changing,&nbsp;and if that protostar is changing in intensity over time, then it's possible that the&nbsp;nebula surrounding it could reflect these&nbsp;changes.</p>

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;">Concealed among the dim suns of Fornax, mixed within the wide fanfare of&nbsp;galaxies that populate the region, lies one of&nbsp;the sky's brightest planetary nebulae, one&nbsp;which richly rewards small telescope users:&nbsp;NGC 1360. This often-overlooked gem has&nbsp;an immediate wow-what-is-that appeal,&nbsp;especially when stumbled upon at the&nbsp;eyepiece. NGC 1360 was long described as&nbsp;a peculiar object until Rudolph Minkowski&nbsp;identified it as a planetary nebula in 1946,&nbsp;though it took a while for the planetary to lose its “peculiar” status. In 1968&nbsp;Lubos Kohoutek called it an “uncommon&nbsp;planetary.” Robert Burnham Jr. refers to&nbsp;NGC 1360 as a “peculiar nebula . . . usually&nbsp;classified as a planetary.” Steven J. Hynes&nbsp;lists NGC 1360 in his <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Planetary Nebulae</span><span class="font19"> as&nbsp;a Type III planetary (a planetary with an&nbsp;irregular disk).</span></p></td>
<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Today we know NGC 1360 is typical of a large evolved planetary nebula. It is&nbsp;also one of the few known examples of&nbsp;a large, high-excitation planetary. Italian&nbsp;astronomer Mario Perinotto (Observatory&nbsp;of Florence), who studied the central star's&nbsp;spectrum in the early 1980s, placed it in the&nbsp;Wolf-Rayet category of planetary nebulae,&nbsp;meaning the central star appears to be in a&nbsp;state of flux and is violently ejecting matter&nbsp;into the surrounding shell.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">The action, of course, is centered at NGC 1360's bright (magnitude 11.4) central star, which has a temperature of at least&nbsp;85,000 kelvin – that's some 14 times hotter&nbsp;than the Sun and at least 540 times more&nbsp;luminous. The central star is a hot subdwarf with only about one-tenth the Sun's&nbsp;diameter and 0.55 its mass. It is a suspected&nbsp;variable star, and, while some early studies&nbsp;revealed it to be a spectroscopic binary, no&nbsp;modern evidence supports that claim.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">The central star does, however, have a claim to fame. As reported in the&nbsp;1996 <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Monthly Notices</span><span class="font19"> of the Royal&nbsp;Astronomical Society, Melven G. Hoare&nbsp;(Max-Planck-Institute for Astronomy) and&nbsp;his colleagues used the </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Extreme Ultraviolet&nbsp;Explorer</span><span class="font19"> (EUVE) satellite to obtain the first&nbsp;extreme ultraviolet spectrum of a planetary&nbsp;nebula's central star – that of NGC 1360.&nbsp;Since most of a central star's emission is&nbsp;emitted in the extreme ultraviolet, the EUVE&nbsp;satellite observations will help astronomers&nbsp;better understand the excitation of winds&nbsp;and nebulae around all hot stars. In 1978,&nbsp;the </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">International Ultraviolet Explorer</span><span class="font19"> (IUE)&nbsp;found that fast winds arise from planetary&nbsp;nebulae. These winds have remarkable&nbsp;speeds of 2,000 to 4,000 kilometers per&nbsp;second, making them among the fastest&nbsp;moving phenomena in the universe. The&nbsp;IUE detection of fast winds is a nice confirmation of the prediction of the interacting&nbsp;winds theory first proposed in 1977 by Chris&nbsp;Purton, Pim Fitzgerald (University of Waterloo, Canada), and Sun Kwok (University of&nbsp;Calgary, Canada).</span></p></td></tr></table><hr>

<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">The interacting wind theory is a simple, one-dimensional model of wind-blown planetary nebulae. In this model, “fast&nbsp;winds” from the nucleus of the planetary&nbsp;nebula blow into the star's former envelope&nbsp;from the inside. A shock that moves outward into the old red-giant envelope and a&nbsp;second interior radiationless shock close to&nbsp;the star, where the radial component of the&nbsp;wind speed drops from its 600 miles per second to Mach 1 in the hot bubble interior.&nbsp;The actual observed nebula consists of the&nbsp;slowly expanding red-giant-envelope halo,&nbsp;which is often ionized and heated by stellar&nbsp;radiation, and the outward moving shock on&nbsp;the inside edge of the halo. Mario Perinotto&nbsp;(Observatory of Florence) confirmed that&nbsp;such fast winds from central stars are common. We now know that NGC 1360 has two&nbsp;obvious gas shells. The inner one is expanding at 27 kilometers per second, while the&nbsp;outer shell is crawling along at 7 kilometers&nbsp;per second. The planetary itself is moving&nbsp;toward us at about 48 kilometers per second.</p></td>

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Not much is heard about NGC 1360's visual appearance from amateurs living at&nbsp;mid-northernlatitudes,which is surprising.&nbsp;Then again, as seen from the north, Fornax,&nbsp;the Furnace, is not among the most glamorous constellations, as its 110 stars, from&nbsp;4th- to 7th-magnitude, all lie near the southern horizon in mid December. Still, NGC&nbsp;1360 is at nearly the same declination as&nbsp;Antares and the globular cluster M4. In fact,&nbsp;Lewis Swift discovered the nebula in 1857&nbsp;from hishomeinCortland(MonroeCounty)&nbsp;in western New York.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">At the time Swift was new to astronomy (he would, however, become one of America's leading astronomers of his day).&nbsp;Inspired by the epochal Leonid meteor&nbsp;shower of 1833, the Great Comet of 1843,&nbsp;and later the astronomical books of Thomas&nbsp;Dick, Swift purchased in 1855 a damaged 3-inch objective from a peddler for five dollars. After making a brass mounting and an&nbsp;eyepieceforthetelescope,hebeganasurvey&nbsp;of the night sky. Two years later he discovered the extremely comet-like glow of NGC&nbsp;1360.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">News of astronomical discovery traveled slowly in those days, especially across the&nbsp;great seas. And amateurs sweeping the skies&nbsp;worked largely in isolation, which is perhaps&nbsp;whyFriedrichWinneckeismentioned asthe&nbsp;object's co-discoverer; he found NGC 1360&nbsp;in January1868 with a 3.5-inch comet seeker&nbsp;at Karlsruhe.

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">With higher power it's still a glorious object, especially if you can appreciate&nbsp;an incredible amount of extremely subtle&nbsp;detail. There's so much to see at the limit&nbsp;of detection. I could spend endless hours&nbsp;on this nebula. But what's most obvious&nbsp;is a bushy brow of nebulosity immediately&nbsp;northeast of the central star. This is part&nbsp;of the nebula's inner shell of gas, which&nbsp;appears to be broken. Two other segments&nbsp;of that shattered shell can be seen: a mottled arc immediately southeast of the central&nbsp;star, and a mottled triangular patch of light&nbsp;immediately southwest of the central star. A&nbsp;look at the opening photograph reveals that&nbsp;this fuzzy wedge of light is probably due to&nbsp;the presence of two close field stars superimposed on the nebula. The outer shell (or&nbsp;crown) has sharp boundaries on the northeastern and southwestern sides. A tiny knot&nbsp;of material (or a very dim star) lies at the&nbsp;outer shell's northeastern edge just beyond&nbsp;the inner brow. And a 13th-magnitude star&nbsp;lies within the outer shell's sharp southern&nbsp;rim and is quite difficult to see. The star&nbsp;seems to separate that sharp rim into two&nbsp;segments.</p>

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Since NGC 1365 is oriented 27<span class="font2"><sup>◦</sup> </span><span class="font19">from edge-on, its spiral nature is comfortably&nbsp;revealed. It has four well-developed arms –&nbsp;two major ones and two rudimentary ones.&nbsp;As with other barred spirals, dust lanes&nbsp;appear on opposite sides of its bar. These&nbsp;lanes lie on the bar's leading edge relative to the galaxy's direction of rotation. Interestingly, the galaxy's outer regions&nbsp;show a decline in rotational rate, which&nbsp;indicates that NGC 1365 lacks a very massive dark halo. This may also be the reason why NGC 1365 has such a very strong&nbsp;bar.</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Less prominent are wisps of spiral structure winding around the core between the galaxy's two major arms. In color photographs, the bar and its immediate surroundings are populated by cool, yellow&nbsp;suns. In contrast, the long graceful arms at&nbsp;the end of the bar are peppered with hot blue&nbsp;stars and pink star-forming regions; these&nbsp;mark the locations where interstellar matter&nbsp;is being compressed at the crests of density&nbsp;waves, triggering star formation. Maximum&nbsp;star formation in these arms occurs at the&nbsp;ends of the bar.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">NGC 1365 is both a Seyfert and a starburst galaxy. Being a Seyfert galaxy means that its small and intensely bright nucleus&nbsp;behaves like a low-energy quasar, ejecting&nbsp;matterepisodicallyintospace.Indeed,radio&nbsp;images of NGC 1365's core show jet-like&nbsp;structures originating from the nucleus and&nbsp;extending about 5<span class="font2"><sup>^^</sup> </span><span class="font19">(</span><span class="font5">∼</span><span class="font19">1 million light-years)&nbsp;in position angle 125</span><span class="font2"><sup>◦</sup> </span><span class="font19">; these jets are aligned&nbsp;with the minor axis of the galaxy. The production of the energy feeding the jet probably comes from a supermassive black hole&nbsp;at the galaxy's heart.</span></p></td>
<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">The Seyfert nucleus, which is a weak radio source, is surrounded by a 8<span class="font2"><sup>^^</sup> </span><span class="font5">× </span><span class="font19">20</span><span class="font2"><sup>^^</sup> </span><span class="font19">ring of&nbsp;radio emission. This radio ring contains a&nbsp;number of hot spots, which may indicate&nbsp;the presence of supernovae and supernova&nbsp;remnants. One bright compact radio source&nbsp;(NGC 1365:A) has been classified as a “radio&nbsp;supernova” and is some 100 times brighter&nbsp;than the bright supernova remnant, Cas A,&nbsp;in our Milky Way.</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">NGC 1365:A is located within one of the superstar clusters that have been discovered&nbsp;in the nuclear region by the Hubble Space&nbsp;Telescope (HST). Indeed, the HST images&nbsp;revealthattheSeyfertnucleusissurrounded&nbsp;by an intense starburst region. The complex patchiness of this region suggests that&nbsp;the galaxy's ancient red stars are probably&nbsp;being overwhelmed by the light of new red&nbsp;giants and supergiants formed in the starburst, which may be young globular clusters. At visible wavelengths, the starburst&nbsp;region is a maelstrom of hot young star clusters and dark dust lanes, which, in infrared&nbsp;light, contain still more newborn clusters.&nbsp;Thus a black hole is probably not the dominant contributor to the energies of the central region.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">NGC 1365 was also part of the HST's Key Project on the Extragalactic Distance&nbsp;Scale, which sought to measure the Hubble constant to an accuracy of 10 percent.&nbsp;To achieve that goal, the team used HST to&nbsp;observe 18 galaxies out to 65 million light-years. They discovered almost 800 Cepheid&nbsp;variable stars, a special class of pulsating&nbsp;star used for accurate distance measurement. The team measured the distance to&nbsp;NGC 1365 at 60 million light-years and the&nbsp;Hubble constant at 70 kilometers per second per megaparsec, with an uncertainty of&nbsp;10 percent. This means that a galaxy appears</p></td></tr></table><hr>

The nuclear region is&nbsp;rather small, about 3</span><span class="font2"><sup>^</sup> </span><span class="font19">, and it's best to try to&nbsp;examine the galaxy with as much power as&nbsp;possible at first, then move progressively to&nbsp;lower and lower powers. The exact power&nbsp;you use will depend on the night and the&nbsp;comfort level provided by your field of view.&nbsp;What's most difficult and most time consuming, I find, is trying to separate the weak&nbsp;spiral region surrounding the nucleus from&nbsp;the bar. Again, try using high magnification first, especially since this region also&nbsp;includes a 13.5-magnitude star 1.3</span><span class="font2"><sup>^</sup> </span><span class="font19">northwest of the nucleus; this star could be mistaken for a supernova. An equally bright star&nbsp;or knot lies on the tip of the western bar.&nbsp;A slightly brighter star appears just off the&nbsp;tip of the eastern bar, which also appears&nbsp;mottled. These stars probably gave Sir John&nbsp;Herschel the illusion that he was resolving this nebula, as he describes in his second observation of the object: “very bright,&nbsp;extended, resolvable nucleus; or has 2 or 3&nbsp;stars involved.”</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">In many respects, NGC 1365 looks like a planetary nebula, like NGC 7009 (Caldwell 55), the Saturn Nebula, in Aquarius.&nbsp;Both have a bright central nucleus, tight&nbsp;elliptical core, large iris of light, and a bar&nbsp;that glows like the rings of Saturn seen&nbsp;edge-on. The difference, in visual appearance, of course, is that NGC 1365 has&nbsp;two long arms sweeping off the edgewise&nbsp;“ring.”</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Curiously, I found the most conspicuous of the two long spiral arms to curve southward from the tip of the eastern&nbsp;bar. Herschel found the “preceding Arc” to&nbsp;be brighter. Herschel's view matches what&nbsp;is seen in photographs, taken with large&nbsp;telescopes; see if you agree.</p></td></tr></table><hr><img src="Hidden Treasures_files/Hidden Treasures-96.jpg" style="width:389pt;height:488pt;"/>

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;">ngc 1399 and ngc 1404 are two giant elliptical galaxies lying 8<span class="font2"><sup>^</sup> </span><span class="font19">apart in the&nbsp;heart of the Fornax Cluster and Eridanus&nbsp;Cloud of Galaxies.

Two other bright&nbsp;members of the Fornax Cluster, NGC 1316&nbsp;(Hidden Treasure 13) and NGC 1365 (Hidden Treasure 17), lie outside this field to the&nbsp;west.</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">The2<span class="font2"><sup>◦</sup> </span><span class="font19">field of view surrounding NGC 1399 and NGC 1404 is a veritable jackpot of extragalactic wonder equal to, if not more impressive than, that centered on M84 and M86&nbsp;in the Virgo Cluster of Galaxies. While both&nbsp;views contain about the same number of&nbsp;galaxies to about magnitude 13.5, the Fornax Cluster is more compact and geometrically simple (most of the galaxies lie in a&nbsp;north–south trending line), making it easier&nbsp;to navigate. Celestial pirates should be able&nbsp;to find the riches of the Fornax Cluster more&nbsp;swiftly and confidently than they would in&nbsp;the Virgo Cluster, which can amount to a&nbsp;fuzzy ball of confusion.</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Next to the Virgo Cluster, the Fornax Cluster is the richest galaxy cluster within&nbsp;100 million light-years of the Milky Way.&nbsp;The entire Fornax Cluster (not just the&nbsp;bright core system described above) contains 340 members and many more possible members. The problem is that until&nbsp;more distance measurements are made,&nbsp;astronomers cannot tell whether a galaxy&nbsp;that appears small is a dwarf member of&nbsp;the cluster or is a more distant and unrelated galaxy. The ongoing Fornax Cluster&nbsp;Survey, however, is addressing this problem&nbsp;by using wide-field spectrographs to measure the distances to some 14,000 objects in&nbsp;the direction of the cluster.</p></td>
<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Like most of the Fornax Cluster's members, NGC 1399 and 1404 are elliptical galaxies, which is not surprising since ellipticals are not only the most common type of galaxy&nbsp;found in clusters but in the nearby universe.&nbsp;NGC 1399 and NGC 1404 are moderately&nbsp;large systems, measuring 53,000 and 43,000&nbsp;light-years in true physical extent; they have&nbsp;luminosities of 20 billion and 15 billion&nbsp;Suns, respectively. Both are nearly spherical&nbsp;orbs with classically smooth appearances.&nbsp;This explains why John Herschel believed&nbsp;NGC 1399 to be a globular cluster. Of course,&nbsp;he had no idea that the fuzz balls we call&nbsp;galaxies were distant island universes. Ironically, as with other ellipticals, NGC 1399 and&nbsp;NGC 1404 have shells populated by globular&nbsp;cluster systems (GCS).</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">The globular cluster systems of galaxies are invaluable probes for measuring the formation and evolutionary history of their&nbsp;hosts. Each cluster has a specific age and&nbsp;metallicity and hence the spectrum and&nbsp;color of an individual cluster is much easier to interpret than the very complex populations of stars seen in their overall integrated light. Their light is dominated by stars&nbsp;with temperatures less than 25,000 K. Starformation models show this temperature&nbsp;puts the main-sequence turnoff in a region&nbsp;where star formation ended in NGC 1399&nbsp;about 200 million years ago. Interestingly,&nbsp;NGC 1399 has an extraordinarily rich GCS&nbsp;while NGC 1404 has a poor one. NGC 1399&nbsp;has some 6,500 globular clusters (<span class="font5">±</span><span class="font19">700),&nbsp;while NGC 1404 has only about 725.</span></p></td></tr></table><hr>

The accretion of a large number of&nbsp;dwarf galaxies, Bekki theorizes, might also&nbsp;help to explain NGC 1399's extraordinarily&nbsp;rich GCS. During the Fornax Cluster Survey, a group of astronomers led by Michael&nbsp;Drinkwater (University of Melbourne, Australia) discovered that indeed, 16 or more&nbsp;galaxies are falling into the main Fornax&nbsp;Cluster at a speed of several hundred kilometers per second. This massive collision&nbsp;of galaxies came as a surprise, because&nbsp;astronomers had previously believed that&nbsp;the Fornax Cluster was quite relaxed.</p>

It&nbsp;also found that NGC 1404 has a comet-like&nbsp;tail, which is consistent with other findings&nbsp;that NGC 1404 is falling toward NGC 1399&nbsp;through the cluster gas.</p></td>

These are two galaxies that seemingly defy all reason – at least&nbsp;in small telescopes. No matter what magnification I use, no matter what combination of eyepieces and Barlow lens I try, I&nbsp;cannot make these galaxies appear like anything else but circular glows that gradually&nbsp;get brighter in the middle. It is as if a comet&nbsp;has split in two and the fuzzy fragments&nbsp;are slowly drifting apart. NGC 1399 appears&nbsp;only slightly brighter than NGC 1404. With&nbsp;averted vision and low power, the outer&nbsp;envelopes may have an ever so slightly out-of-round shape, but one has to work hard to&nbsp;imagine it.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">The view of these two galaxies seen together in such purity of form is tanta-lizingly haunting. It is like seeing some&nbsp;ghostly apparition, ill of form, or, the rising mist at sunrise, which, to paraphrase&nbsp;Joseph Conrad in <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">The Lagoon</span><span class="font19">, breaks into&nbsp;drifting patches before vanishing into thin&nbsp;flying wreaths.</span></p>

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;padding:0pt 0pt 0pt 8pt;">Buta (University of Alabama) says this alignment is typical for the inner rings of&nbsp;barred spiral galaxies. He also&nbsp;notes that the inner ring&nbsp;is actually a “pseudoring,”&nbsp;meaning it is not continuous but comprised of several&nbsp;spiral sections. The brightest segment starts in the&nbsp;northeast just beyond the&nbsp;bar's minor axis and extends&nbsp;through three-quarters of a&nbsp;revolution. The corresponding symmetric component,&nbsp;which begins in the southwest, is not as prominent.&nbsp;Further out, the galaxy has</p>

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">The object is quite conspicuous under a dark sky. Indeed, on the evening of Decem-ber17,1868,FriedrichWinneckediscovered&nbsp;NGC 1398 while sweeping the sky for comets&nbsp;from Karlsruhe, Germany. He was using a&nbsp;modest 4.5-inch refractor built by Reinfelder&nbsp;&amp; Hertel. Winnecke also independently discovered NGC 1360 with a 3.5-inch comet&nbsp;seeker in January of that year. The following&nbsp;autumn, Latvian astronomer Eugen Block&nbsp;independently discovered both NGC 1360&nbsp;and NGC 1398 on October 18, 1879, with a&nbsp;4-inch comet seeker. At the time of these discoveries, this region of Fornax belonged to&nbsp;Eridanus.</p></td>
<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">In high-resolution images, NGC 1398 is an impressive, seemingly symmetrical system. It has a dense inner ring (with a ropelike texture) that surrounds a bright central&nbsp;bulge and bar. The galaxy is inclined 40<span class="font2"><sup>◦&nbsp;</sup></span><span class="font19">from edge-on, so the inner ring is elongated&nbsp;with its major axis parallel to the bar. Ron&nbsp;long, narrow blue spiral arms, each of which&nbsp;completes almost a full revolution, possibly&nbsp;forming another pseudoring structure. The&nbsp;arms are dappled with discrete bright areas&nbsp;but these are quite faint when compared to&nbsp;the nuclear region. In the outermost galaxy,&nbsp;the arms appear as dim, flocculent structures. Buta points out that when the inner&nbsp;ring of a galaxy is well defined and conspicuous, the outer ring is usually quite faint,&nbsp;and vice versa.</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">At a glance, the inner regions of NGC 1398 look strikingly similar to those of M95, a&nbsp;barred spiral galaxy in Leo. These galaxies have nearly the same apparent magnitude and dimensions. But these similarities are an illusion: M95 is twice as close as&nbsp;NGC 1398, and NGC 1398 is twice as large –&nbsp;with a physical diameter of 107,000 light-years and a total mass of 300 billion Suns.&nbsp;Here is another illusion at work. Visually,&nbsp;NGC 1398 looks smaller than the apparent&nbsp;diameter listed in the table, that's because&nbsp;those dimensions include the galaxy's dim</p></td></tr></table><hr>

<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Still, the galaxy is quite easy to see.

<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;">Whenever we venture into the night, our eyes unconsciously try to distinguish familiar shapes and forms in the nocturnal landscape. It's a primitive response&nbsp;that stems from the days when our distant&nbsp;ancestors needed to know friend from foe.&nbsp;It must have been the same when early man&nbsp;first looked into the night sky with wondering eyes. Here were myriad sparks in an&nbsp;unfathomable void. How their senses must&nbsp;have reeled. The stars were untouchable.&nbsp;Norcouldtheybeheardorsmelt.Theycould&nbsp;only be seen. They were more mysterious&nbsp;than any night creature whose watchful eyes&nbsp;reflected light just beyond the glow of early&nbsp;human's protective fires.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Unlike the animals that threatened attack, though, the stars remained fixed to the firmament. They moved together as one, like&nbsp;some distant migrating herd. The longer&nbsp;humansgazedintothepeeringeyesofnight,&nbsp;the more comfortable and understanding&nbsp;they became with the stars. Fear waned.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Soon the brightest stars became familiar. Some were used in navigation. Others were organized into recognizable patterns –&nbsp;ones that reflected the simplicity of the&nbsp;times. Our early ancestors saw bears, dogs,&nbsp;and hunters; later, strong men and remarkable women. They placed personal treasures among the stars (a crown, a harp) and&nbsp;other objects they adored (a woman's hair).&nbsp;They removed from Earth the things they&nbsp;feared (a scorpion, a serpent, and a dragon).&nbsp;Fertile imaginations began to weave myths&nbsp;and legends that united these new patterns&nbsp;among the stars, to personalize them. Their&nbsp;myths reflected the struggles of their times&nbsp;and the morals they wishedtopreserve. The&nbsp;world of lights in the night sky became a&nbsp;safe record of their lives and beliefs. The sky&nbsp;was an open book for all to read. The stories could not be destroyed as long as oral&nbsp;tradition remained alive.</p></td>
<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">To this day we still look up into the night sky and see these age-old patterns, and we&nbsp;still enjoy the myths associated with them.&nbsp;But we have also penetrated the imaginary&nbsp;sphere of the naked-eye sky. Armed with&nbsp;binoculars and telescopes we have explored&nbsp;and mapped new vistas. And though we no&nbsp;longer fear the stars, we have yet to lose that&nbsp;time-honored desire to make order out of&nbsp;chaos.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">We forever seek patterns in the sky, because that is how we get acquainted with&nbsp;the night. Once we apply binoculars or a&nbsp;telescope, the number of patterns one can&nbsp;create are limited only by the imagination.&nbsp;Still, only a few microconstellations have&nbsp;found their way into both the literature and&nbsp;our hearts. By far, one of the most popular micropatterns of the modern sky is a&nbsp;long chain of stars in Camelopardalis, which&nbsp;rides high in the north on cold February&nbsp;evenings.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">The late Franciscan and amateur astronomer Lucien J. Kemble (1922–1999)&nbsp;discovered the asterism in 1980 with a&nbsp;pair of 7 <span class="font5">× </span><span class="font19">35 binoculars. At the time, he&nbsp;was sweeping the skies above his home in&nbsp;Saskatchewan (Alberta, Canada), when he&nbsp;noticed “a beautiful cascade of faint stars&nbsp;tumbling from the northeast down to the&nbsp;open cluster NGC 1502 [(Hidden Treasure&nbsp;23)].” Kemble immediately wrote a letter of&nbsp;discovery to </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Sky &amp; Telescope</span><span class="font19"> columnist Walter Scott Houston, who, in turn, popularized&nbsp;the find in his December 1980 Deep-Sky&nbsp;Wonders column. To honor the discoverer,&nbsp;Houston later suggested the asterism be&nbsp;called Kemble's Cascade. He was “shocked”&nbsp;when he first saw it in binoculars because,&nbsp;he said, “there was a totally unexpected</span></p></td></tr></table><hr>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;">gem . . . a celestial waterfall of dozens of 9th- and 10th-magnitude stars.

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">How did such a beautiful sight go unnoticed for so&nbsp;long? There are several reasons. First, Camelopardalis is&nbsp;one of the most obscure constellations in the night sky;&nbsp;while its borders cover a significant 757 square degrees&nbsp;of sky, Camelopardalis has&nbsp;no stars brighter than fourth&nbsp;magnitude. Second, for some&nbsp;reason, pallid regions of the&nbsp;naked-eye sky, especially</p><div style="float:right;layout-flow:horizontal;"><img src="Hidden Treasures_files/Hidden Treasures-107.jpg" style="width:255pt;height:228pt;"/></div>

<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;">those near the celestial poles, seem unattractive to backyard astronomers. And&nbsp;third, and perhaps most important, only&nbsp;three stars in the Cascade are bright enough&nbsp;to have been included in the most popular&nbsp;atlas of the day: <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Norton's Star Atlas</span><span class="font19">.</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">While many sources say that Kemble's Cascade has 20 “members,” that is highly&nbsp;subjective. In Kemble's original drawing,&nbsp;which appears in Houston's original article,&nbsp;twice that many stars can be counted. What&nbsp;you see depends on what aperture you use&nbsp;and what magnitude limit you impose. At a&nbsp;glance with binoculars at least 20 stars can&nbsp;beseenintheCascadefromadarksky.These&nbsp;are the obvious members of the group. The&nbsp;brightest shines at magnitude 5.0, and it is&nbsp;your guiding light.</p></td>

It's&nbsp;about 8<span class="font2"><sup>◦</sup> </span><span class="font19">north-northwest of Alpha (</span><span class="font5">^</span><span class="font19">) Persei, at the end of a straight line with Alpha&nbsp;and Gamma (</span><span class="font5">^ </span><span class="font19">) Persei; it's also the same&nbsp;star we use (along with Epsilon (</span><span class="font3">ε </span><span class="font19">) Cas) to&nbsp;find the famous Double Cluster in Perseus.&nbsp;Although Iota Cas is only slightly fainter than&nbsp;Eta Per, it is in a more isolated region of&nbsp;sky. The best way to find Iota is to imagine a straight line passing through Delta (</span><span class="font5">^</span><span class="font19">)&nbsp;and Epsilon Cas – the easternmost stars in&nbsp;the famous W asterism – and continue it for&nbsp;another 5</span><span class="font2"><sup>◦</sup> </span><span class="font19">to the northeast.

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">While binoculars and rich-field telescopes give the best views of the Cascade, do explore the chain with higher powers&nbsp;because it includes many interesting pairings and a few doubles. When sweeping&nbsp;the entire chain at 72<span class="font5">×</span><span class="font19">, I noticed several&nbsp;matching pairs of stars aligned parallel in&nbsp;places like the rails of a train track.

If you do,&nbsp;you've just seen open cluster NGC 1502 with&nbsp;the unaided eye. Magnitude estimates of&nbsp;the cluster vary. In their book <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Star Clusters,&nbsp;</span><span class="font19">Archinal and Hynes list it as magnitude 6.9.&nbsp;It's magnitude 5.7 in both the </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Deep-Sky Field&nbsp;Guide</span><span class="font19"> and Luginbuhl and Skiff's </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Observing Handbook and Catalogue of Deep-Sky&nbsp;Objects.</span><span class="font19"> My visual magnitude estimate of 6.0&nbsp;was made with 7 </span><span class="font5">× </span><span class="font19">50 binoculars and is a&nbsp;happy medium.</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Although the cluster measures 20<span class="font2"><sup>^</sup> </span><span class="font19">across, its core is very tight and bright. Four of&nbsp;the cluster's stars are immediately obvious&nbsp;in small binoculars. Through the 4-inch at&nbsp;23</span><span class="font5">×</span><span class="font19">, a brilliant double star (ADS 2984AB)&nbsp;shines like a finely cut topaz near the cluster's center. Both components shine at magnitude 6.9 and are simply mesmerizing.&nbsp;Admiral William Henry Smyth called it a&nbsp;“neat double star,” whose components are&nbsp;“decidedly red.” But under higher powers,&nbsp;this double transforms into what Houston&nbsp;called a “celestial fireworks display involving nine components, seven of which are&nbsp;between 7th and 13th magnitude and are&nbsp;within reach of a good 4-inch telescope.”</span></p></td>
<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">The nineteenth-century astronomer Wilhelm Struve (STF) discovered the main 7th-magnitude pair in 1830 when they were separated by 18<span class="font2"><sup>^^</sup> </span><span class="font19">in position angle 303</span><span class="font2"><sup>◦</sup> </span><span class="font19">.&nbsp;They haven't changed position much: in&nbsp;2002 they were only 17.7</span><span class="font2"><sup>^^</sup> </span><span class="font19">apart in position angle 305</span><span class="font2"><sup>◦</sup> </span><span class="font19">. While both are spectroscopic binaries, the northern component (HD 25638) is the variable star SZ&nbsp;Camelopardalis, which dips 0.3 magnitudes&nbsp;every 2.7 days. It is the brightest star (by&nbsp;a few tenths of a magnitude) in the cluster when the variable is at maximum. The&nbsp;estimated mass of the eclipsing body is 18.6&nbsp;Suns. It lies 0.07</span><span class="font2"><sup>^^</sup> </span><span class="font19">from its primary and has&nbsp;been resolved by speckle interferometry –&nbsp;a method of “beating the seeing” by taking hundreds of extremely fast exposures to&nbsp;freeze the blurring effect of the atmosphere,&nbsp;then combining the images. This tertiary&nbsp;body is also believed to be a close binary.&nbsp;Luginbuhl and Skiff note that the A component may also be variable. These highly&nbsp;luminous (spectral type </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">B</span><span class="font19">0) stars appear&nbsp;to be the only members of 5-million-year-young NGC 1502 not on the main sequence.&nbsp;In age, NGC 1502 is comparable to NGC 663&nbsp;(Caldwell 10) in Cassiopeia, and NGC 1893&nbsp;in Auriga, which recent estimates place at&nbsp;9 and 4 million years young, respectively.&nbsp;NGC 1502 is dimmed by about 0.5 magnitude by intervening interstellar dust&nbsp;between 815 light-years and 2,800 light-years. This dust cloud keeps NGC 1502 from&nbsp;having a more prominent position in the&nbsp;naked-eye sky.</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Sharing the center-stage spotlight is yet another double, actually a triple star, of&nbsp;equal fascination. Wilhelm Struve also&nbsp;found these stars in 1830. The brightest&nbsp;members shine, once again, at equal magnitude (10.0) and are separated by 22.5<span class="font2"><sup>^^&nbsp;</sup></span><span class="font19">at position angle 334</span><span class="font2"><sup>◦</sup> </span><span class="font19">. The more southerly&nbsp;of the pair has a magnitude 10.5 companion only 5.6</span><span class="font2"><sup>^^</sup> </span><span class="font19">away at position angle 132</span><span class="font2"><sup>◦</sup> </span><span class="font19">.&nbsp;Together Struve 484 and 485 look like a&nbsp;miniature version of the famous Trapezium&nbsp;in M42, the Great Orion Nebula.</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">In the 4-inch more than a dozen suns, many in pairs, surround NGC 1502's tight&nbsp;core of double stars. Archinal and Hynes&nbsp;list, however, about 63 members, so those&nbsp;with larger telescopes should be prepared&nbsp;for an even more outstanding display. The&nbsp;brightest members form a lazy X shape centered on the bright double star Struve 485.&nbsp;One lane of stars crosses Struve 485 roughly&nbsp;from west to east, while the other crosses it&nbsp;from the southwest – but the northeastern&nbsp;arm curves abruptly to the north and opens&nbsp;into a Y of stars. It takes little imagination to&nbsp;see these stars and this pattern as the skull-and-cross-bones symbol of the pirate's Jolly&nbsp;Roger. With that in mind, we can now&nbsp;return to low power and, borrowing from&nbsp;the pages of J. M. Barrie's play <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Peter Pan,&nbsp;</span><span class="font19">see NGC 1502 as Captain Hook's ship, the&nbsp;</span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Jolly Roger,</span><span class="font19"> moored in Kidd's Creek (Kemble's Cascade) under a thick fog. And what&nbsp;of the cluster's stars? They are Tinkerbell&nbsp;(Struve 485) and her luminous fairy friends&nbsp;dancing unnoticed above the clouds of&nbsp;Neverland.</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">What makes an object a hidden treasure is not so much what it means to the astrophysical community but what it means to you.&nbsp;The fact that Kemble's Cascade is not a true&nbsp;cluster does little to change its wide appeal.&nbsp;The fact that NGC 1502 is a true cluster does&nbsp;little to stifle the imagination. We look at&nbsp;celestial objects because they entertain us.&nbsp;Who would argue that Kemble's Cascade is&nbsp;not a near-perfect alignment of stars? Who&nbsp;would argue that NGC 1502, with its magnificent doubles, does not have the power to&nbsp;grab our attention and not let go? No, even&nbsp;on the coldest of winter nights, the opportunity to see a little line of stars splashing&nbsp;down onto a galactic cluster spanning more&nbsp;than 15 light-years across space gives us the&nbsp;peace and serenity we seek each time we&nbsp;step outside with our telescopes, even if it&nbsp;only means we go off to bed with sigh and a&nbsp;smile.</p></td></tr></table><hr><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"><img src="Hidden Treasures_files/Hidden Treasures-109.jpg" style="width:389pt;height:512pt;"/></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all">

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;">For such an obscure constellation, Camelopardalis certainly has its wealth of celestial treasures: the galaxies&nbsp;IC 342 (Caldwell 5), NGC 2403 (Caldwell 7),&nbsp;and NGC 2655 (Hidden Treasure 48); Kemble's Cascade (Hidden Treasure 21); open&nbsp;cluster NGC 1502 (Hidden Treasure 23);&nbsp;and the bright, though woefully neglected,&nbsp;planetary nebulae IC 3568 (Hidden Treasure&nbsp;64) and NGC 1501.</p></td>
<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Popularly known as the Oyster Nebula, NGC 1501 has a peculiar texture. In images&nbsp;taken with large telescopes, NGC 1501 displays a conspicuous magnitude 14.5 central&nbsp;star surrounded by a highly dimpled shell of&nbsp;pale blue gas. Tug the imagination, and you&nbsp;can see that star as a perfect pearl inside an&nbsp;oyster's rough and irregular shell. NGC 1501&nbsp;is 5,000 light-years distant, and its expanding shell of gas measures 1.4 light-years&nbsp;wide in true physical extent. By comparison, it's 4<span class="font17"><sup>1</sup><sub>2</sub> </span><span class="font19">times farther away than the Ring&nbsp;Nebula (M57) in Lyra and 3 </span><span class="font17"><sup>1</sup><sub>2</sub> </span><span class="font19">times larger.&nbsp;In distance and size, NGC 1501 is more&nbsp;comparable to NGC 3195 (Caldwell 109) in&nbsp;Chamaeleon.</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Judging by the size of its shell, NGC 1501 appears moderately young. Consider&nbsp;a smoke ring produced by someone puffing on a cigarette. The smoke ring is densest</p></td></tr></table><hr>

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;">and smallest when first formed close to the lips. As time passes, the smoke ring expands&nbsp;and becomes less dense. Ultimately the ring&nbsp;becomes so tenuous that it can no longer&nbsp;be seen. In the natural world, volcanoes&nbsp;also produce smoke rings that behave in&nbsp;similar fashion; the photograph here shows&nbsp;one being expelled by Italy's Stromboli Volcano in the South Tyrrhenian Sea. Likewise, small and bright planetary nebulae&nbsp;are younger than their larger and fainter&nbsp;counterparts.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">In his book <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Cosmic Butterflies: The Colorful Mysteries ofPlanetaryNebulae</span><span class="font19">,SunKwok explains the simplest way to estimate a planetary's dynamical age; it is a model that has&nbsp;been used for a century or so: “If planetary nebulae are expanding at a constant&nbsp;rate, then one can calculate the age of the&nbsp;nebula by dividing its size by the expansion&nbsp;rate.” The largest planetary nebula known,&nbsp;has a diameter of 4 light-years. Given that a&nbsp;typical expansion velocity of a planetary's&nbsp;shell is 20 kilometers per second, the life&nbsp;span of a planetary nebula works out to be&nbsp;30,000 years. The 1.4-light-year-wide shell&nbsp;surrounding NGC 1501's central star, then,&nbsp;is nearing middle age.</span></p></td>
<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Observations of the shell's spectrum show that NGC&nbsp;1501 is a thin ellipsoid&nbsp;with a pair of large lobes&nbsp;and a multitude of smaller&nbsp;bumps spread across the&nbsp;nebula's surface (the rough&nbsp;and irregular texture of&nbsp;the oyster shell). In a 2001&nbsp;<span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Astronomy and Astrophysics&nbsp;Abstract</span><span class="font19">, R. Ragazzoni&nbsp;(Astronomical Observatory&nbsp;of Padova) and colleagues&nbsp;revealed NGC 1501's threedimensional structure to be a boiling complex of bubbles. The main nebula consists of an almost oblate ellipsoid with a&nbsp;bright equatorial belt. The shell's surface is&nbsp;deformed by several bumps reminiscent of&nbsp;boiling convection cells. The complexity of&nbsp;these expanding shells isa result of an interaction between the intense and fast wind&nbsp;from the extremely hot central star that contains about 55 percent of our Sun's mass.</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">As with the central star in NGC 1360 (Hidden Treasure 16), NGC 1501's central star is a Wolf-Rayet star – a very luminous, very&nbsp;hot star whose outer shell was expelled during its red-giant phase. There are two types&nbsp;of Wolf-Rayet stars: Type WN, whose spectrum shows prominent emission lines of&nbsp;helium and hydrogen, and type WC, whose&nbsp;spectrum is hydrogen deficient and dominated by carbon, oxygen, and helium lines.&nbsp;NGC 1501's central star is a WC-type Wolf-Rayet star. It is also a variable, showing&nbsp;erratic brightness variations as large as 0.1&nbsp;magnitude but with 10 independent pulsation periods ranging from 19 to 87 minutes. These periods change dramatically&nbsp;over month to year time scales. These period&nbsp;changes are related to the way vast streams</p></td></tr></table><hr><div style="float:left;layout-flow:horizontal;"><img src="Hidden Treasures_files/Hidden Treasures-112.jpg" style="width:256pt;height:236pt;"/></div>

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">One of the reasons NGC 1501 may have been neglected is that some sources list its&nbsp;photographic magnitude (13.3) rather than&nbsp;its visual magnitude. And I find its listed&nbsp;visual magnitude (11.5) to be one magnitude too faint. The object is actually quite&nbsp;bright and easy to see in small apertures,&nbsp;being slightly fainter and a little smaller than&nbsp;M76 in Perseus.

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">With 101 <span class="font5">×</span><span class="font19">, the planetary immediately reveals itself as a glorious orb glowing&nbsp;densely even with direct vision. Fainter stars&nbsp;canbeseenaroundthenebula.Withaverted&nbsp;vision a faint annulus can be seen quite&nbsp;readily and it looks like the Ring Nebula at&nbsp;low power. There also appear to be some&nbsp;enhancements in the ring that pop into view&nbsp;with averted vision, though it's hard to pinpoint the exact location of these lights. This&nbsp;phenomenon is quite common to plane-taries. Also, although the planetary has a&nbsp;high degree of concentration and surface&nbsp;brightness at low power, at high power I&nbsp;find this apparent “denseness” fades dramatically. In small apertures, the planetary&nbsp;should look best at 227</span><span class="font5">×</span><span class="font19">, though you should&nbsp;find your own comfort zone. I thought 302</span><span class="font5">×&nbsp;</span><span class="font19">was a bit much, but that might also have&nbsp;been due to eye strain after 3 hours of&nbsp;intense observing, so do try the highest&nbsp;power possible that makes you feel comfortable.</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">At high power the ellipse is quite evident, as is the “hole” with averted vision. The&nbsp;north and south sides of the inner ellipse&nbsp;are brighter than its outer extensions and&nbsp;the northernarcappears to becomprised of&nbsp;two bright beads. Try as I might, I could not&nbsp;see the central star, which has been reported&nbsp;by several amateurs to be visible in an 8-inch telescope, even if the ring itself is blown&nbsp;to near invisibility. Observing from the dark&nbsp;skies ofMountPinosinCalifornia,KentWal-lace found NGC 1501 to be a moderate-sized&nbsp;circular disk in his 8-inch f/10 reflector at&nbsp;65<span class="font5">×</span><span class="font19">. He too found the disk mottled at 200</span><span class="font5">×</span><span class="font19">.&nbsp;He also notes that the nebula responds well&nbsp;to O-III and UHC filters. Alas, he too could&nbsp;not see the central star.</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">If you're looking for a true treasure hunt, then, your challenge is to see NGC 1501's&nbsp;elusive 14.5-magnitude pearl. The key to&nbsp;success, I suspect, is a combination of aperture and magnification. Use as high a power&nbsp;as the evening will take to open up the lips of&nbsp;the blue oyster and see if you can't visually&nbsp;grab your prize.</p></td></tr></table><hr><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"><img src="Hidden Treasures_files/Hidden Treasures-114.jpg" style="width:389pt;height:512pt;"/></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all">

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;">Planetary nebula ngc 1535 in Eridanus is one of the sky's brightest and&nbsp;most satisfying objects of its class. In color&nbsp;photographs it shines like an aquamarine&nbsp;gem locked in ice. Others have likened it to&nbsp;an eye. Indeed, its piercing glow has earned&nbsp;it the nickname Cleopatra's Eye, in deference to the last great queen of Egypt, whose&nbsp;seductive gaze was enhanced by her use of&nbsp;blue eye shadow. The name Cleopatra's Eye,&nbsp;in turn, was inspired by the Eye of Horus, a&nbsp;powerful symbol used in ancient Egyptian&nbsp;funerary rites and decoration to protect one&nbsp;from evil.</p></td>
<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">If NGC 1535 is hypnotic, it's because its physical structure draws you in. This multiple shelled planetary nebula consists of a&nbsp;bright inner annulus with a much fainter,&nbsp;though uniformly bright, crown. In images&nbsp;taken with large telescopes the inner annulus displays a classically sharp, though irregularly round, outer rim, while its inner edge&nbsp;is greatly serrated. Seen together, these features look characteristically like the iris of&nbsp;a human eye. A magnitude 11.6 central star&nbsp;burns at the center of the shell. And it is this&nbsp;bright spark of light that draws our attention, because it seems to mirror the light of&nbsp;the viewer's soul.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">NGC 1535 is a moderately high-excitation planetary nebula with features very similar&nbsp;to the Eskimo Nebula (Caldwell 39). Its shells&nbsp;appear slightly elliptical, with the major axis&nbsp;of the inner ring oriented approximately at&nbsp;position angle 35<span class="font2"><sup>◦</sup> </span><span class="font19">. From our vantage point&nbsp;on Earth, however, we are looking straight&nbsp;down the major axis of an inverted funnel of&nbsp;gas. Recent models of NGC 1535's structure&nbsp;describe a bipolar inner shell, which is being&nbsp;constricted by a ring of dense material in the&nbsp;equatorial plane of the central star. We see&nbsp;one lobe expanding toward us at a rate of&nbsp;20 kilometers per second; the largely spherical outer shell is expanding at about half&nbsp;that rate. Ultraviolet observations, particularly those taken with the Hopkins Ultraviolet Telescope aboard the </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Astro-1</span><span class="font19">Space Shuttle mission in December 1990, confirm the&nbsp;presence of a fast wind streaming out from&nbsp;the planetary's 0.67 solar-mass central star,&nbsp;whose surface temperature is near 70,000 K.&nbsp;The measured speed of this wind is fantastic – about 2,000 kilometers per second. But&nbsp;such speeds are common to these objects.&nbsp;In fact, they are theoretically mandatory to&nbsp;produce the observed density and expansion velocities of planetary nebulae.</span></p></td></tr></table><hr>

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">That NGC 1535 is not a more popular object among amateurs is amazing. William&nbsp;Lassell described it as the most interesting and extraordinary object of the kind he&nbsp;had ever seen. And Christian Luginbuhl and&nbsp;Brian Skiff rate it as “one of the best plan-etaries for amateur viewing.” While NGC&nbsp;1535 is in the southern constellation Eridanus, its declination of nearly <span class="font5">-</span><span class="font19">13</span><span class="font2"><sup>◦</sup> </span><span class="font19">places&nbsp;it at essentially the same height above your&nbsp;horizon as M72 and M73 in Aquarius. And&nbsp;it shines roughly at the same magnitude as&nbsp;the famous Ring Nebula (M57) in Lyra. But&nbsp;now consider that NGC 1535 is nearly five&nbsp;times more distant than M57, thus a physically larger system; it measures 1.2 light-years in true extent, while the Ring Nebula&nbsp;spans only 0.4-light-years across.</span></p></td>
<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">One reason NGC 1535 is neglected is its seemingly dreary surroundings. It lies&nbsp;in a field devoid of bright stars. To find&nbsp;this “celestial jellyfish,” as the late <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Sky &amp;&nbsp;Telescope</span><span class="font19"> columnist Walter Scott Houston&nbsp;called it, start with brilliant Beta (</span><span class="font5">^</span><span class="font19">) Orio-nis (Rigel). Nearly 20</span><span class="font2"><sup>◦</sup> </span><span class="font19">to the west-southwest&nbsp;is the obvious magnitude 3.0 star Gamma&nbsp;(</span><span class="font5">^ </span><span class="font19">) Eridanus (Zaurak). A fist held at arm's&nbsp;length will cover about 10</span><span class="font2"><sup>◦</sup> </span><span class="font19">of sky, so you&nbsp;want to look for the Gamma Eri “two fists”&nbsp;west-southwest of Rigel.</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Zaurak has an interesting history, in that its name is derived from the Arabic <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Al Nair&nbsp;al Zaurak,</span><span class="font19"> meaning “the Bright Sar of the&nbsp;Boat.” But this name wandered there from&nbsp;the constellation Phoenix, whose Alpha (</span><span class="font5">^</span><span class="font19">),&nbsp;Kappa (</span><span class="font5">^</span><span class="font19">), Mu (</span><span class="font5">^</span><span class="font19">), Beta (</span><span class="font5">^</span><span class="font19">), Nu (</span><span class="font5">^</span><span class="font19">), and&nbsp;Gamma (</span><span class="font5">^ </span><span class="font19">) stars form an elegant curving line like that of a primitive boat. And&nbsp;though I have not seen it mentioned elsewhere, Gamma Eri is also part of a similar&nbsp;curving line consisting of Gamma, Pi (</span><span class="font5">^ </span><span class="font19">),&nbsp;Epsilon (</span><span class="font3">ε </span><span class="font19">), and Delta (</span><span class="font5">^</span><span class="font19">) Eri; and the bright&nbsp;star in this more northerly boat is indeed&nbsp;Gamma.</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">There is no mistaking Gamma Eri, because it is the brightest star in the region.&nbsp;Train your binoculars on it, and you will&nbsp;see another elegant curve of three 6th-magnitude stars just north of it. If you center the easternmost star (<span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font19">) in that curve in&nbsp;your telescope, you will be within striking&nbsp;distance of NGC 1535, which is almost 2 </span><span class="font17"><sub>2</sub><sup>1 </sup></span><span class="font2"><sup>◦&nbsp;</sup></span><span class="font19">due east.

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;padding:0pt 0pt 0pt 8pt;">they failed to separate the central star from the inner&nbsp;annulus. The key then to seeing the central star is to use&nbsp;<span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">very</span><span class="font19">high power. I also recommend using your </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">foveal</span><span class="font19"> vision&nbsp;at high power, which will help&nbsp;you to pick out the central&nbsp;star while suppressing the&nbsp;surrounding nebulosity.

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">At 23<span class="font5">× </span><span class="font19">in the 4-inch, NGC 1535 is a tiny blue-gray disk, which is so nearly stellar that I would have passed over it in a&nbsp;sweep. With averted vision, it looks slightly&nbsp;fuzzy. The nebula's round appearance and&nbsp;pale blue color at 72</span><span class="font5">× </span><span class="font19">are reminiscent of&nbsp;Neptune's disk seen through backyard telescopes, which is why I call it the Ghost of&nbsp;Neptune Nebula.</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">At high power the structure in the annulus is complex. The problem with eking out details, though, appears to be one&nbsp;of separation. In other words, it's difficult&nbsp;to separate the bright central star from&nbsp;the equally bright inner annulus, which&nbsp;extends to about 20<span class="font2"><sup>^^</sup> </span><span class="font19">in diameter. Do not be&nbsp;afraid to use very high power, even though&nbsp;the nineteenth-century English observer&nbsp;Thomas W. Webb said that with a telescope&nbsp;of 3</span><span class="font17"><sub>1</sub><sup>7</sup><sub>0</sub> </span><span class="font19">aperture, the nebula was “bright and&nbsp;round, with low powers . . . but not bearing&nbsp;magnifying.”</span></p></td>
<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">The reason that many amateurs have failed to see the planetary's central star in&nbsp;telescopes 6-inches and smaller is because&nbsp;of uniform brightness, is best observed at&nbsp;low power. Still, on that marginal night I&nbsp;saw the central star and at least four discrete&nbsp;knots asymmetrically positioned along the&nbsp;inner ring. The problem was that, due tothe&nbsp;variable seeing, the details sailed in and out&nbsp;of view.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">On another extremely clear and transparent morning with much steadier seeing, I cleanly separated the central star from its&nbsp;inner ring, which was dappled with knots.&nbsp;At low power, the outer shell, or crown, was&nbsp;sharper and more circular than that of any&nbsp;planetary I've seen. In photographs, a faint&nbsp;star appears in the northern section of the&nbsp;nebula's crown, but I could not detect it. If it&nbsp;is there, it blends in well with the nebulosity.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Seeing a dappled inner ring probably inspired many of our astronomical heroes&nbsp;of yesteryear to see this object as more of a&nbsp;star cluster than as a nebula. For instance,&nbsp;in his second observation of the object,&nbsp;William Herschel said that the object is&nbsp;“round on the borders and is probably avery&nbsp;compressed cluster of stars at an immense</p></td></tr></table><hr>

And Lord Rosse, peering through his&nbsp;magnificent 72-inch Leviathan at Parson-stown, said he could make out the nucleus as&nbsp;“granular.”</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">How fantastic a time it must have been to be looking through such a behemoth,&nbsp;peering deep into the heavens and trying to fathom the riddles of the universe.&nbsp;How Herschel's theories of the origin and&nbsp;nature of the nebulae must have influenced&nbsp;the wide-open minds of his contemporaries&nbsp;and those immediately following. How limiting it proves the eye and mind to be when&nbsp;it comes to interpreting the cosmos.</p>

Night after night, this&nbsp;rich stellar region sails up&nbsp;and over the pole until, by&nbsp;February, the Perseus Arm of&nbsp;our spiral galaxy dominates&nbsp;the view after sunset. And it&nbsp;is here that many amateurs&nbsp;will train their telescopes and&nbsp;discover some of the sky's&nbsp;most prominent star clusters and stellar associations,&nbsp;including the famous Double&nbsp;Cluster (Caldwell 14), M34,</p><div style="float:right;layout-flow:horizontal;"><img src="Hidden Treasures_files/Hidden Treasures-121.jpg" style="width:258pt;height:233pt;"/></div>

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;">and the Alpha Persei Moving Cluster (Hidden Treasure 14). But there is a rather distinctive cluster, NGC 1528, which is casually overlooked in favor of its more popular neighbors.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">William Herschel, the object's discoverer, classified it as one of his “Pretty Much&nbsp;Compressed Clusters of [bright] or [faint]&nbsp;Stars.” The Rev. Thomas W. Webb called it&nbsp;a “[b]right” and a “good low-power object.”&nbsp;And the Third Earl of Rosse observed&nbsp;two red stars in the cluster through the&nbsp;great Leviathan telescope at Birr Castle in&nbsp;Ireland.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">How observers prior to William Herschel had missed this jewel of the night borders on the mysterious. You'll find NGC&nbsp;1528 1<span class="font2"><sup>◦</sup> </span><span class="font19">north-northwest of 5th-magnitude&nbsp;b Persei in the Champion's knee, and just&nbsp;30</span><span class="font2"><sup>^</sup> </span><span class="font19">northwest of a magnitude 7.5 star (</span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font19">).&nbsp;NGC 1528 shines at magnitude 6.2 and&nbsp;makes a decent naked-eye challenge for&nbsp;anyone under dark skies. Only on one night,&nbsp;though, did I suspect seeing its core of&nbsp;brightly scattered suns. It is a fine object for&nbsp;binoculars, and its brightest members will&nbsp;start to appear to the dedicated observer&nbsp;even in the smallest pair.</span></p></td>
<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">In 7 <span class="font5">× </span><span class="font19">50 binoculars the cluster is round and well formed. Its brightest stars appear&nbsp;unmistakably in my antique telescope&nbsp;against the cluster's unresolved background, which shines with a cometlike&nbsp;luster.

Yet few guide books&nbsp;pay much attention to this hidden treasure.&nbsp;In </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Celestial Harvest</span><span class="font19">, however, James Mullaney sings praises to the cluster, sharing&nbsp;these comments by variousobservers:“Gor-geous . . . glows like a gem,” and “Radiant cluster – entire zone truly inspiring.”&nbsp;Another observer suggests using low power&nbsp;to appreciate this cluster fully.

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;">powers,highpowershouldnotbeneglected, which I will soon explain.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">The cluster is indeed large and bright at 23<span class="font5">× </span><span class="font19">in the 4-inch. It reveals a veil of well-resolved suns scintillating in front of a fuzzy&nbsp;backdrop of fainter stars. The brightest ones&nbsp;are curved in rows, like waves. Brent Archi-nal and Steven Hynes catalog some 165 stars&nbsp;in NGC 1528, with the brightest shining&nbsp;at magnitude 8.7, splashed across 13 light-years of space. So NGC 1528 has the same&nbsp;linear extent as M34 in Perseus. NGC 1528,&nbsp;however, is about 1,000 light-years more distant than that more famous cluster. And,&nbsp;with an estimated age of nearly 370 million&nbsp;years, NGC 1528 is nearly three times older&nbsp;than M34; it's closer in age to M39in Cygnus.&nbsp;But these are modestly young ages. The oldest known open cluster in our galaxy is NGC&nbsp;6791 in Lyra, which is some 7 to 8 </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">billion&nbsp;</span><span class="font19">years old.</span></p></td>
<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">If you relax your gaze at low power, NGC 1528's brightest stars form a teardropshaped asterism that is elongated along&nbsp;a northwest–southeast axis; its narrow tip&nbsp;points to the southeast. In <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Star Hopping&nbsp;for Backyard Astronomers</span><span class="font19">, Alan M. Mac-Robert notes that through a 6-inch reflector under suburban skies, a dark U-shaped&nbsp;bay can be seen at the cluster's western end,&nbsp;where it is outlined by seven bright stars.&nbsp;That U can also be extended a bit further&nbsp;to the southwest, making the asterism look&nbsp;like the Sickle of Leo. Now relax your gaze&nbsp;again as you slightly defocus the telescope;&nbsp;do you see how the U forms the brighter&nbsp;half of a broad and lazy “m”-shaped asterism, the southeasternmost star of which is a&nbsp;fine double star. Return to sharp focus and&nbsp;scan the quadrant of sky immediately to the&nbsp;northeast of the “m.” Here you will find a&nbsp;coarse scattering of dimmer suns, which, if&nbsp;you concentrate, form a near mirror-image&nbsp;of the “m.” That's one reason why I call&nbsp;this cluster, the “m &amp; m” cluster. But there's&nbsp;another reason.</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">The Russian astronomer, A. V. Loktin (Ural University Astronomical Observatory), has&nbsp;cataloged NGC 1528 and NGC 1545, which is&nbsp;less than 1 <span class="font17"><sup>1</sup><sub>2</sub> </span><span class="font2"><sup>◦</sup> </span><span class="font19">to the southeast, as a possible&nbsp;binary cluster – one that probably formed&nbsp;throughtidalcapture.Thetwoclustersshare&nbsp;similar galactic coordinates, ages, distances,&nbsp;and mean radial velocities. If they are a true&nbsp;pair, then Perseus has more than one Double Cluster: NGC 869 and NGC 884 (Caldwell&nbsp;14), and NGC 1528 and NGC 1545, what I call&nbsp;the “m &amp; m” Double Cluster. Paradoxically,&nbsp;by the way, double clusters seem to be quite&nbsp;rare in the Milky Way, and yet they are quite&nbsp;common in the Large Magellanic Cloud.</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">But don't move on to NGC 1545 just yet; there's more to see in NGC 1528. If you&nbsp;slightly defocus the telescope again and&nbsp;sweep your vision across NGC 1528's face,&nbsp;you may notice that MacRobert's dark bay&nbsp;is but one of many wisps of darkness that&nbsp;meanders through the region. Under dark&nbsp;skies, the cluster appears to be composed&nbsp;of shards of starlight separated by dark&nbsp;cracks, as if a crystal teardrop had accidentally shattered on a sheet of black ice.&nbsp;Under high power and sharp focus, NGC&nbsp;1528 is comprised of a healthy dose of miniasterisms, all of which look hazy at low&nbsp;power but resolve into distinct geometrical&nbsp;patters under 101<span class="font5">×</span><span class="font19">. A beautiful Y-shaped&nbsp;mini-asterism (like M72 in Aquarius) can&nbsp;be found a few arcminutes northeast of the&nbsp;northeasternmost star in the U (near the&nbsp;center of the cluster). With high powers,&nbsp;manyofthestarsformlovelypairs,triangles,&nbsp;arcs, and squiggly lines. The visual fabric of&nbsp;this cluster is extremely patchy.</span></p></td></tr></table><hr>

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Finally, if you use your imagination to see this cluster as an open bag of “m &amp;&nbsp;m's”; you can go hunting for colored ones –&nbsp;specifically, four intensely red carbon stars&nbsp;have been found in the cluster, which might,&nbsp;or might not, be members. Try as I might,&nbsp;when I visually sifted through my “bag,” I&nbsp;did not notice any pronounced color differences. Seeing these intensely red carbon&nbsp;stars might require larger apertures than a4-inch. Regardless, looking for fine details in&nbsp;NGC 1528 is like using a geologist's loop to&nbsp;look for the fine and varied crystalline structures locked in a shard of granite. So look&nbsp;foryourownpatterns,useyourimagination,&nbsp;and set out on your own treasure hunt.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">NGC 1545 is a most fascinating object for small telescope users. First, it's a difficult&nbsp;object to see with the naked eye for two reasons: at 6th magnitude, the cluster borders&nbsp;on the limit of naked-eye visibility for an&nbsp;extended object; and it lies less than <span class="font17"><sub>2</sub><sup>1</sup></span><span class="font2"><sup>◦</sup> </span><span class="font19">eastnortheast of a pair of 5th-magnitude stars,</span></p></td>
<td valign="top" width="50%"><img src="Hidden Treasures_files/Hidden Treasures-123.jpg" style="width:185pt;height:233pt;"/>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;">the brightest of which is b Persei. Under dark skies, all I see is a fuzzy wedge of light, which&nbsp;is only the combined glow of the two 5th-magnitude suns. So don't be fooled.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">In fact, in 7 <span class="font5">× </span><span class="font19">50 binoculars, the idea of a cluster in the listed position seems&nbsp;ludicrous. All that is visible are two stars&nbsp;(magnitude 7.7 and 7.1) oriented north–&nbsp;south, respectively. If you look very hard&nbsp;with averted vision, you might also detect&nbsp;a magnitude 8.1 star immediately northnorthwest of the brighter (southern) star in&nbsp;the pair. So, at first blush, it appears that&nbsp;NGC 1545 is indeed like M40. But it isn't. In&nbsp;my antique telescope, for instance, I can see&nbsp;some dimmer suns swimming around these&nbsp;three suns and, at 23</span><span class="font5">× </span><span class="font19">in the 4-inch, a clear&nbsp;pattern of about a dozen suns emerges. The&nbsp;close southern pair of stars is actually a tight&nbsp;triangle of suns, which lies at the center of a&nbsp;five-pointed-star-shaped pattern like a pentagram, the ancient Gnostic “blazing star,”&nbsp;which was a symbol relating to the magic&nbsp;and mystery of the night-time sky. The Pentagram in NGC 1545 is comprised of about a&nbsp;dozen 10th- to 11th-magnitude suns, many&nbsp;of which are in pairs. These stars are only&nbsp;the first tier of bright stars that can be seen&nbsp;in small telescopes with direct vision. It's&nbsp;amazing how many stars suddenly appear&nbsp;with averted vision. The Pentagram appears&nbsp;to be surrounded by a ghostly mist that wafts&nbsp;in and out of view with averted and direct&nbsp;vision, respectively.</span></p></td></tr></table><hr>

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">With 72<span class="font5">× </span><span class="font19">and 101 </span><span class="font5">×</span><span class="font19">, nearly three dozen additional dim suns can be counted inside&nbsp;an imaginary pentacle surrounding the Pentagram. By alternating between averted and&nbsp;direct gazes, the cluster's crisp background&nbsp;stars seem to appear and disappear like&nbsp;lights blinking on a Christmas tree. I find&nbsp;the affect most pronounced when I avert&nbsp;my gaze away from the cluster toward the&nbsp;2 : 00 position angle and then sweep in an&nbsp;arc between the 2 : 00 and 4 : 00 position&nbsp;angles. Seen another way, the stars look like&nbsp;the stick figure of a man running.</span></p></td>
<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">While trying to detect faint stars can become an obsession, don't forget to scrutinize the cluster's brighter suns. Most striking are the color differences in an acute&nbsp;triangle at the cluster's core. The brightest&nbsp;star shines with a lemon-orange light, while&nbsp;the companion to the northeast is strawcolored; it is also an easily resolved double.&nbsp;And the sun marking the west-southwest&nbsp;corner of the triangle has an icy blue hue.&nbsp;The bright star marking the northern point&nbsp;of the Pentagram is another fine double&nbsp;star, STF 519 ( Wilhelm Struve 519): a yellow magnitude 7.7 primary and a white&nbsp;magnitude 9.4 secondary 17.9<span class="font2"><sup>^^</sup> </span><span class="font19">to the northnorthwest. Finally, look at the southeastern arm of the Pentagram. It curves southward, then north, forming a fine ellipse of&nbsp;starlight, in the shape of a head. This seems&nbsp;appropriate considering that the pentagram once symbolized the relationship of&nbsp;the head to the four limbs, signifying, in&nbsp;essence, that every man and woman is&nbsp;a star.</span></p></td></tr></table><hr><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"><img src="Hidden Treasures_files/Hidden Treasures-124.jpg" style="width:389pt;height:512pt;"/></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all">

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">It might seem odd that William Herschel would have discovered NGC 1647 but not IC 4756 in Serpens Cauda (Hidden&nbsp;Treasure 93), which has the&nbsp;same apparent diameter. But&nbsp;the reason is obvious. First&nbsp;NGC 1647 is not projected&nbsp;against a dense part of the&nbsp;Milky Way. And though parts&nbsp;of Taurusare seen against the&nbsp;outer reaches of the Milky&nbsp;Way, NGC 1647 lies in a&nbsp;bay between two luminous&nbsp;folds of starlight. As Sigfrid&nbsp;Raab writes in his 1922 book,&nbsp;<span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">A Research on Open Clusters</span><span class="font19">, “[NGC 1647 is a] large,&nbsp;very thin [cluster], distinctly&nbsp;separated from the environs and probably containing exclusively bright stars.”&nbsp;So the cluster is not projected against a rich star&nbsp;field. Second, though the&nbsp;cluster does not have a&nbsp;strong central condensation,&nbsp;most of its brighter stars&nbsp;are found in the central 15</span><span class="font2"><sup>^</sup> </span><span class="font19">,&nbsp;which matches the field of&nbsp;view used by William Herschel in his sweeps. IC 4756,&nbsp;on the other hand, </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">is</span><span class="font19"> seen&nbsp;against a rich Milky Way star&nbsp;cloud and it has no apparent central condensation of&nbsp;starlight. Indeed, William Herschel's own&nbsp;words that he thought NGC 1647 was “perhaps a projecting point of the Milky Way,”&nbsp;suggests that this coarse scattering of stars&nbsp;might actually not be a cluster but a portion&nbsp;of Milky Way.</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">The Rev. T. W. Webb's description of the cluster in his <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Celestial Objects for Common&nbsp;Telescopes</span><span class="font19"> is rather perplexing, for he writes:&nbsp;“Stars 8.5 to 10, round wide pair” (I believe</span></p></td></tr></table><hr>

<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">At higher powers, the cluster does not have the snap it does at lower powers. But&nbsp;do spend some time sweeping across the&nbsp;cluster's face. A careful study&nbsp;of the brightest stars will&nbsp;reveal that many of them&nbsp;have single or multiple companions. In fact, the cluster is alive with doubles.&nbsp;Some mini-clusters can also&nbsp;be found amid the chaos. In&nbsp;fact, the two 9th-magnitude&nbsp;doubles at the cluster's core&nbsp;each have a dim companion, making the central triangle comprised of two minitriangles and a solitary sun.&nbsp;Other asterisms include a&nbsp;tiny cross (just southeast of&nbsp;the southeasternmost star in&nbsp;the central triangle) and a&nbsp;faint clone of M73, which lies&nbsp;to the west of the westernmost double in the central&nbsp;triangle. Since NGC 1647 is&nbsp;not densely packed, the view&nbsp;remains best at low power; in fact, in his&nbsp;<span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Visual Astronomy of the Deep Sky</span><span class="font19">, Roger&nbsp;Clark suggests 20</span><span class="font5">× </span><span class="font19">for a 6-inch and 27</span><span class="font5">× </span><span class="font19">for&nbsp;an 8-inch.</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Despite its prominence in the sky, NGC 1647 is a poorly studied cluster. Aside its&nbsp;proximity to the Hyades as seen projected&nbsp;on the sky, NGC 1647 has nothing to do&nbsp;with it. At 190 million years old, NGC 1647&nbsp;is about 400 million years younger than the&nbsp;Hyades and 11 times more distant. In true&nbsp;physical extent, NGC 1647 spans 20 light-years of space, while the Hyades spans only&nbsp;14.5 light-years. NGC 1647 is more similar to&nbsp;M7 in Scorpius in both age and true physical&nbsp;extent. Had NGC 1647 been about 1,000&nbsp;light-years closer, it would have been just&nbsp;as apparent as M7 but seen much higher&nbsp;in the northern sky.

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;">Lepus asterism – two joined trapezoids of binocular stars that mimic the shape of the&nbsp;main body of the Hare; it is comprised of Iota&nbsp;(<span class="font5">^</span><span class="font19">), Kappa (</span><span class="font5">^</span><span class="font19">), Lambda (</span><span class="font5">^</span><span class="font19">), Nu (</span><span class="font5">^</span><span class="font19">), 8 Leporis,&nbsp;and IC 418. The planetary's light is so concentrated that it appears as a 9th-magnitude&nbsp;“star” in hand-held binoculars. IC 418 also&nbsp;marks the northeast arm of a </span><span class="font17"><sub>2</sub><sup>1 </sup></span><span class="font2"><sup>◦</sup></span><span class="font19">-long,&nbsp;Y-shaped asterism (</span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font19">) of binocular stars&nbsp;(oriented north–south) at the northeast corner of Little Lepus; I call this other asterism&nbsp;the Martini Glass, and IC 418 is the “olive.”</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">IC 418 dodged detection until its slightly swollen form was detected on photographic&nbsp;plates taken at Harvard Observatory in&nbsp;Cambridge, Massachusetts. I call it the&nbsp;Chameleon Nebula for two reasons: its&nbsp;tiny size makes it blend into the background starlight, and the color one sees&nbsp;(if any) seems to depend on the aperture&nbsp;and magnification used. For instance, in&nbsp;his 12-inch reflector, the late southern sky&nbsp;explorer Ernst Hartung saw a “bright bluish&nbsp;disk . . . with a bluish central star.” I get&nbsp;mixed impressions: at 72<span class="font5">× </span><span class="font19">in the 4-inch the&nbsp;nebula alternates between bluish and yellowish tints, while at 101</span><span class="font5">×</span><span class="font19">, the star looks&nbsp;blue and the ring yellow. Steve Gottlieb (El&nbsp;Cerrito, California), using a 18-inch reflector at 82</span><span class="font5">×</span><span class="font19">, saw the nebula with a “slight red-dishtingeatitsedge.”Othershavedescribed&nbsp;the nebula as being pink, orange, and&nbsp;brown.</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Many of these colors can be seen in a stunning Hubble Space Telescope (HST) image (shown here in black and white), which&nbsp;shows the planetary's magnitude 10.5 central star burning within a blue inner ellipse&nbsp;surrounded by a pale lavender crown with&nbsp;a fiery yellow rim. All is “[g]lowing like a&nbsp;multi-faceted jewel.” The HST image also&nbsp;shows the nebula patterned with an intricate weave – one that astronomers have&nbsp;likened to a drawing made by a spirograph.&nbsp;With imagination, the entire scene looks as&nbsp;if someone has dropped a ruby into a well&nbsp;of purple mist, creating a complex arrange-mentofripples.ThestrangetextureofIC418&nbsp;may be related to the chaotic winds flowing from the central star (HD 35914) – a&nbsp;confirmed variable star that shows irregular&nbsp;brightness changes over a period of days and&nbsp;cyclic variations every 6.5 hours. Of course,&nbsp;it is the ultraviolet radiation streaming from</p></td>

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;">this hot white dwarf star that excites the surrounding atoms in the nebula causing it&nbsp;to fluoresce. Interestingly, mid-infrared and&nbsp;radio images have found the nebula to be&nbsp;carbon rich. The intensity of the infrared&nbsp;emission spills over to the visual end of the&nbsp;red spectrum. So, while the planetary shines&nbsp;with a typical blue-green light, some red colorationwarms its visual hue. What colors an&nbsp;observer sees in IC 418, then, may be determined by the color sensitivity of his or her&nbsp;eyes. Observers should try observing IC 418&nbsp;with an H-Beta filter. When Gottlieb tried,&nbsp;he said “the halo brightened while the central star dramatically faded, leaving a more&nbsp;noticeable disk.”</p>

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;">young, perhaps only a few thousand years old.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Visually, IC 418 is a fine object for small telescope users, though it requires high&nbsp;magnifications to see its finer details. In the&nbsp;4-inch, the planetary is a pale blue star at&nbsp;23<span class="font5">×</span><span class="font19">. Only on nights when the atmosphere&nbsp;is extremely calm and steady can I convince myself that at low power IC 418 looks&nbsp;ever so slightly larger than the surrounding stars – and that's with averted vision&nbsp;and much time trying. At 72</span><span class="font5">× </span><span class="font19">the planetary&nbsp;still appears stellar with a glance, but now&nbsp;the use of averted vision will begin to show&nbsp;its slightly swollen character. Now take the&nbsp;time to study what you see really. In fact,&nbsp;try placing IC 418 in and out of your foveal&nbsp;vision. When I do this I can clearly separate the planetary's 10th-magnitude central&nbsp;star from the surrounding annulus, which,&nbsp;as I mentioned earlier, appears to be a mix&nbsp;of blue and yellow light. This impression&nbsp;is consistent with reality, since the nebula's&nbsp;outer rim is “yellow-orange” (like smog) and&nbsp;its core is blue. By moving my eye around,&nbsp;I am probably catching quick glimpses of&nbsp;both parts of the nebula. Overall, the nebula is slightly elongated north–south.</span></p></td>
<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Now increase the power. When I use 101<span class="font5">×</span><span class="font19">, the central star is clearly separated from a&nbsp;yellow ringoflight.Withkeenavertedvision&nbsp;I also suspected a crown of extremely dim&nbsp;light. Increasing the power to 151</span><span class="font5">× </span><span class="font19">reveals&nbsp;the yellow ring of light surrounding the central star to have a bright inner edge that&nbsp;appears symmetrically beaded, like a pearl&nbsp;necklace. It's hard notto imagine a complete&nbsp;string of miniature pearls lining the ring's&nbsp;inner edge. Adding a 1.7</span><span class="font5">× </span><span class="font19">Barlow (302</span><span class="font5">×</span><span class="font19">)&nbsp;helps to separate the central star further&nbsp;from the ring, which is still extremely radiant. In fact, on one night, whenIwasobserv-ing from the 7,000-feet elevation of Mauna&nbsp;Loa volcano, I placed the 3-mm eyepiece in&nbsp;a 1.8 </span><span class="font5">× </span><span class="font19">Barlow, then placed this combination&nbsp;ina3</span><span class="font5">× </span><span class="font19">Barlow (907</span><span class="font5">×</span><span class="font19">) – and the inner ring&nbsp;and central star were still manageable. This&nbsp;was the most power I have ever used on a&nbsp;deep-sky object with this telescope. Despite&nbsp;all my efforts, I could bring out the object's&nbsp;blue coloration more than the yellow, which&nbsp;is odd, since my eyes tend to be blue sensitive.</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">That there is a red planetary nebula in Lepus with a carbon-rich shell is interesting because 7<span class="font2"><sup>◦</sup> </span><span class="font19">to its west-southwest is R&nbsp;Leporis,Hind'sCrimsonStar.ThisMira-type&nbsp;variable is a prime example of a carbon star –&nbsp;the reddest stars known. It has been called&nbsp;a “gleaming crimson jewel.” Julius Schmidt&nbsp;(1823–1884) described it as “of the most&nbsp;intense crimson, resembling a blood-drop&nbsp;on the background of the sky; as regards&nbsp;depth of colour, no other star visible in these&nbsp;latitudes could be compared with it.” If you&nbsp;want to follow this ruby star through its light&nbsp;changes, R Lep varies between magnitude&nbsp;7.3 and 9.8 every 420 days. To see this glistening drop of blood as red as a Vampire's&nbsp;kiss, look for it when the star is at minimum&nbsp;light. As with the waxing and waning of the&nbsp;red planet Mars, the intensity of the color&nbsp;diminishes with the greater brilliancy of the&nbsp;star's light.</span></p></td></tr></table><hr><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"><img src="Hidden Treasures_files/Hidden Treasures-135.jpg" style="width:389pt;height:508pt;"/></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;">

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">It was not uncommon for the Arabs to have many names for their beloved stars,&nbsp;whose presence breathed life into the barren desert at night: “Thou canst not know&nbsp;how much we Arabs depend on the stars,”&nbsp;Shaykh Ilderimtold Ben Hur atthe Orchid of&nbsp;Palms.“Weborrowtheir names in gratitude,&nbsp;and give them in love.”</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;padding:0pt 0pt 9pt 0pt;">The original Arabic name for Lambda Ori and its attendant stars was <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Al-Hak'ah</span><span class="font19"> or </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Al-Haq'ah</span><span class="font19"> (and has descended to us as </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Heka&nbsp;</span><span class="font19">and </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Hika</span><span class="font19">). These words refer to the fuzzy&nbsp;appearance of Orion's Head as “a White&nbsp;Spot.” Brent Archinal finds this description&nbsp;of Orion's head certainly relevant as, he&nbsp;says, “it describes the whole group of three&nbsp;stars and perhaps the cluster Collinder 69&nbsp;itself.” Archinal's contention is supported&nbsp;by the Roman astronomical poet Gaius (or&nbsp;Marcus) Manilius who wrote in the first-century ad:</span></p>

<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;">Ptolemy (ad 83–161) included these “boundless spheres” in his <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Almagest,</span><span class="font19"> the&nbsp;most authoritative astronomical manual&nbsp;throughout the whole of Europe and the&nbsp;Near East until at least the middle of&nbsp;the fifteenth century. He described them&nbsp;collectively as “The Nebulous One,” or&nbsp;as Kenneth Glyn Jones has in </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">The Search&nbsp;for the Nebulae,</span><span class="font19"> a “Mistiness in Orion's&nbsp;Head.” The Persian astronomer Al-Sufi (ad&nbsp;903–986) refined the object's appearance&nbsp;in </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">The Book of the Fixed Stars,</span><span class="font19"> writing that&nbsp;“[t]he first star of the Giant [Orion] is the&nbsp;cloud which is in the head and which is&nbsp;composed of three close stars.” And Ulugh&nbsp;Begh (1394–1449), the celebrated Tartar&nbsp;prince and astronomer, likewise realized&nbsp;that the “nebula” in Orion's head was&nbsp;caused by the proximity of three close stars:&nbsp;“No.1 Orionis. The northernmost of those&nbsp;in the head of the Giant: however, they&nbsp;are three close together” Al-Sufi then is&nbsp;arguably the first to imply that the fuzziness&nbsp;is an illusion.</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">It is no surprise that dim stars close to one another can have a fuzzy, cometlike&nbsp;appearance. In fact, even the best comet&nbsp;observers, when working near the limits&nbsp;of their vision, have been fooled by such&nbsp;close pairings of stars. This phenomenon&nbsp;may have been known, at least indirectly,&nbsp;to Pliny the Elder, who in his <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Natural History</span><span class="font19"> says, “Some comets move, like planets, while others remain fixed.” The most&nbsp;famous fuzzy double of them all, of course,&nbsp;is M40, in Ursa Major, a simple duet of telescopic suns that the great Polish astronomer&nbsp;Johannes Hevelius (1611–1687) apparently&nbsp;mistook as a nebula in his “old, imperfect&nbsp;instrument.”</span></p>

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;padding:0pt 0pt 0pt 8pt;">the power of the telescope. The fact that he did not&nbsp;include the nebula component of Orion's Sword in&nbsp;another drawing is not a comment about his ability as an&nbsp;observer but of his resolute&nbsp;state of mind; as far as Galileo&nbsp;was concerned, nebulosity&nbsp;did not exist, so why record&nbsp;it.

Rays of fainter&nbsp;stars stream eastward from this line like the&nbsp;fins of a robinfish. So the fuzzy nature of the&nbsp;Head of Orion, from under adark sky, is truly&nbsp;the accumulated haze teeming with suns.&nbsp;“Although there is no nebula here,” writes&nbsp;Garrett P. Serviss in his 1923 <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Astronomy with&nbsp;an Opera Glass,</span><span class="font19"> “yet these stars, as seen with&nbsp;the naked eye, have a remarkably nebulous&nbsp;look.” But unbeknown to Serviss, there is;&nbsp;Orion's Head is immersed in a roughly 4</span><span class="font2"><sup>◦</sup> </span><span class="font19">-wide cloud of gas and dust – the emission&nbsp;nebula Sharpless 2–264 and a dappling of&nbsp;dark nebulae discovered by E.

<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Galileo was probably the first to see these stars as a cluster: “A diagram of the nebula called that of Orion's Head in which I&nbsp;have counted twenty-one stars.” Seeing so&nbsp;many stars and no nebulosity in this region&nbsp;was testament to his growing belief – that all&nbsp;nebulae would be resolved into stars under&nbsp;Arizona – with a spectrograph that can&nbsp;deploy optical fibers to analyze the light&nbsp;from 100 celestial objects simultaneously.&nbsp;His data revealed an additional 266 low-mass, pre-main-sequence stars among&nbsp;40,000 field stars. After using these data&nbsp;to recreate the star-formation history of&nbsp;the region, Mathieu and his collaborators&nbsp;concluded that the region was “profoundly&nbsp;affected by a supernova 1–2 million years&nbsp;ago.” The entire region, then, presents a&nbsp;snapshot of the molecular cloud 1–2 million years after newly formed, Type-<span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">OB</span><span class="font19"> stars&nbsp;ravaged it with their radiation. A separate&nbsp;proper-motion study of stars in the region&nbsp;suggests that the star formation was concentrated in an elongated cloud extending&nbsp;from the dark nebula Barnard 35 (about 2 </span><span class="font17"><sub>2</sub><sup>1 </sup></span><span class="font2"><sup>◦&nbsp;</sup></span><span class="font19">southeast of Lambda) to the Barnard 30 dark&nbsp;cloud (about 3</span><span class="font2"><sup>◦</sup> </span><span class="font19">northwest of Lambda).</span></p>

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">While long-exposure photographs show the entire region covered by an extensive&nbsp;but faint diffuse nebulosity, the question&nbsp;is, can this be seen with the naked eye. In&nbsp;other words, is there more to the mistiness&nbsp;that cloud's Orion's Head than the illusion of&nbsp;clustered starlight? I believe the nebula can&nbsp;be seen but only from a very dark-sky site,&nbsp;withavertedvision,onlywhentheairis<span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">very&nbsp;</span><span class="font19">dry. To see it, you must sweep your averted&nbsp;gaze back and forth between Orion's shoulders and look for an ever so slight increase&nbsp;in brightness in the area. But I would like to&nbsp;leave the verdict up to you. Perhaps the use&nbsp;of a nebula filter will resolve the issue.</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Seeing the nebula with the unaided eye is one of those observations that will perhaps forever reside in that fuzzy razor-thin&nbsp;world that lies between belief and disbelief.&nbsp;And this leads me to my final point. You may&nbsp;be wondering why I called this cluster Aunt&nbsp;Margaret's Mirror. It has nothing to do with&nbsp;me. (I don't have an Aunt Margaret, at least&nbsp;to my knowledge.) No, it refers to Sir Walter Scott's tale, “My Aunt Margaret's Mirror,”&nbsp;from his 1828 <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">The Keepsake:</span><span class="font19"> “And amidst&nbsp;such shadowy and doubtful light . . . imagination frames her enchanted and enchanting visions, and sometimes passes them&nbsp;upon the senses for reality.” These words,&nbsp;I find, clearly mirror the difficulty of seeing&nbsp;the emission nebula clouding Orion's Head.</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Actually, the story's narrator was commenting on his Aunt Margaret's superstitious tendencies. As the reader learns, she avoids looking into a mirror, when she is&nbsp;alone in her chamber for the evening.</p></td></tr></table><hr>

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;">Whenyoulookatorion'ssword with the naked eye, what do you see? Most&nbsp;observers would agree that the Sword is&nbsp;comprised of a short row of three naked-eye&nbsp;stars. Of these stars Manilius, a Roman,&nbsp;wrote: “[Orion] marches on and measures&nbsp;a vast space. / On each shoulder a bright&nbsp;star displayed / And three obliquely grace&nbsp;his hanging blade.” And with little effort,&nbsp;most observers today can also see that the&nbsp;middle star in the Sword, Theta (<span class="font5">^ </span><span class="font19">) Orionis,&nbsp;looks fuzzy. Indeed, the middle star is M42,&nbsp;the Great Nebula in Orion. Few sights in&nbsp;the night sky excite beginners more than&nbsp;being able to detect this, the most glorious&nbsp;of all nebulae, without optical aid. M42's&nbsp;beauty is only magnified in binoculars&nbsp;and telescopes, which also reveal its little&nbsp;companion nebula, M43. The Great Nebula&nbsp;in Orion was the first object that Sir William&nbsp;Herschel observed on March 4, 1774, with&nbsp;his first workable homemade telescope (a&nbsp;5.5-foot focal-length reflector); and it was&nbsp;the last object he viewed on January 19,&nbsp;1811, with his 40-foot reflector. The view&nbsp;of M42–M43 is so comely that it has the&nbsp;power to draw our attention away from&nbsp;other bright nebulae and clusters in the&nbsp;immediate vicinity. Any of these lesser&nbsp;known objects would be stellar showpieces&nbsp;had they not been so close to this “single&nbsp;misty star, / Which is the second in a line of&nbsp;stars / That seem a sword beneath a belt of&nbsp;three,” to quote from “Merlin and Vivien,”&nbsp;the sixth poem in Lord Alfred Tennyson's&nbsp;1857 </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Idylls of the King</span><span class="font19">.</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;padding:0pt 0pt 14pt 0pt;">While we are fast to say that the Orion Nebula is the middle of three naked-eye&nbsp;stars in Orion's Sword, it's not true. It is the&nbsp;third of <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">four</span><span class="font19"> deep-sky objects that make up&nbsp;Orion's Sword; actually, in the Bayer depiction of Orion, the Sword is fully sheathed, so&nbsp;we should say that the chain of four objects&nbsp;marks the Sword's scabbard.</span></p>
<p class="font5" style="text-align:justify;">OPEN CLUSTER NGC 1981</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;">The northernmost star in Orion's Sword is not a star at all but the 4th-magnitude open&nbsp;star cluster NGC 1981 (Hidden Treasure 30) –&nbsp;a clip of jewels set into Orion's black-leather&nbsp;scabbard. This loose gathering of 20 or so&nbsp;suns is spread across an area of sky comparable to that of the full Moon. Eight of these&nbsp;scintillating stars can be easily seen with7 <span class="font5">×&nbsp;</span><span class="font19">50 binoculars: look for a tight arc of three&nbsp;6th-magnitude suns (orientednorth–south)&nbsp;set between a solitary 7th-magnitude star&nbsp;to the east and four roughly 7th-magnitude&nbsp;suns, in a Y-shaped pattern, to the west. Seen&nbsp;with north up in the antique telescope, these&nbsp;stars join with others to formwhatlookslike&nbsp;anoldcoalcar.Thenorthernmostarmofthe&nbsp;“Y” is itself a little arc of three suns; here&nbsp;is the heap of coal sticking up out of the&nbsp;basket.</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">NGC 1981 is the northernmost object in the Orion <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">OB</span><span class="font19">1c Association and measures&nbsp;11 light-years across in true physical extent.&nbsp;Alan MacRobert in his popular book </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Star&nbsp;Hopping</span><span class="font19">, calls NGC 1981 a “bevy of stellar&nbsp;beauties.” He continues, “Most telescopists&nbsp;miss the beauty of this little-known cluster because of its relative sparseness and&nbsp;large size. However, discerning binocular&nbsp;users will immediately recognize the charm&nbsp;of NGC 1981, especially amid such grand&nbsp;surroundings.” Indeed, in the early twentieth century, Harvard astronomer E.C. Pickering regarded it as one of his top 60 objects&nbsp;in the heavens, perhaps because it contains two stunning double stars: Struve 750&nbsp;and Struve 743. They are the brightest stars&nbsp;in the cluster and form a nice binocular&nbsp;pair.</span></p></td>
<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Through the 4-inch, Struve 750 is a wonderful magnitude 6.4 and 8.4 pair, separated by 4.2<span class="font2"><sup>^^</sup></span><span class="font19">;inhis</span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Cycle of Celestial Objects</span><span class="font19">, Adm.&nbsp;William Henry Smyth called it a “delicate&nbsp;double star in the wide-spread cluster on&nbsp;Orion's sword.” He saw the components as&nbsp;“lucid white” and “pale blue.” I see them as&nbsp;glacial blue and pleasantly pink. Struve 743,&nbsp;on the other hand, is a very tight magnitude&nbsp;7.7 and 8.2pair,separatedby1.8</span><span class="font2"><sup>^^</sup></span><span class="font19">.Curiously,&nbsp;the closer pair was discovered first, in 1830,&nbsp;and the wider pair a year later. Struve 743 is&nbsp;a fine test for a 3-inch lens, because even the&nbsp;slightest bit of atmospheric turbulence will&nbsp;cause it to blend into a single orb.</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Of the cluster as a whole Smyth penned, “The principal members of this group of&nbsp;stars, are of the 6th and 7th magnitudes, with&nbsp;some smaller; and from their brightness and&nbsp;disposition form a capital test for the light&nbsp;of a telescope. It was examined by [John&nbsp;Herschel], and entered in his Catalogue of&nbsp;1830; whence it may lay claim to being an&nbsp;aggregated and connected assemblage, and,&nbsp;comparatively speaking, not very remote&nbsp;from us.”</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">These words are extremely revealing, because they tell us that William Herschel&nbsp;failed to notice the group as a cluster, which&nbsp;supports the argument that the stars of&nbsp;NGC 1981 would have been too separated&nbsp;in his telescope to be easily discerned as a&nbsp;stellar aggregation. At 72<span class="font5">× </span><span class="font19">and 101</span><span class="font5">× </span><span class="font19">in the&nbsp;4-inch, the cluster divides into three distinct</span></p></td></tr></table><hr>

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;padding:0pt 0pt 27pt 0pt;">The region is not as free from nebulosity as it might look. Long-exposure photographs and charge coupled device (CCD) images show a dim, sepulchral veil of emission nebulosity pervading the area of the&nbsp;cluster. The question is, can we detect any of&nbsp;it visually? Sweeping the entire region with&nbsp;the nearly 3<span class="font2"><sup>◦</sup> </span><span class="font19">field of view of the 4-inch, I&nbsp;noticed something spectacular. The cluster&nbsp;NGC 1981 and the nebula NGC 1977 appear&nbsp;to be surrounded by a grayish “fog,” which&nbsp;is best visible if I sweep the scope in large&nbsp;arcs around these objects. It's a dimly lit&nbsp;nebulosity that looks like a&nbsp;stain in the Orion starfield,&nbsp;like wet blotter. The glow is&nbsp;evident only by the absence&nbsp;of starlight, especially when&nbsp;the field is compared to other&nbsp;starfields around it. Such a&nbsp;sight can only be appreciated with a wide field of view&nbsp;under a dark sky. So I encourage everyone who has wide-field capability to hunt down&nbsp;this ghostly glow – “a lovely&nbsp;baleful star / Veiled in gray&nbsp;vapor”; to quote again from&nbsp;“Merlin and Vivien.”</span></p></td>

NGC&nbsp;1980 does, however, have its own history.&nbsp;It was discovered on January 31, 1786, by&nbsp;William Herschel, who wrote, “</span><span class="font5">^ </span><span class="font19">Orionis&nbsp;with its neighboring stars are involved in an&nbsp;extremely faint milky nebulosity to a great&nbsp;extent.” He cataloged it as the 31st object&nbsp;in his list of very large nebulae (his Class V&nbsp;objects).</span></p></td></tr></table><hr>

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Anyone who has seen the Orion nebula in a wide-field telescope from a dark-sky&nbsp;site knows that Iota Orionis is connected to&nbsp;the Orion Nebula by a long, faint loop of&nbsp;nebulosity. Of that loop and its dark interior, nineteenth-century English observer,&nbsp;Thomas W. Webb wrote, “A considerable&nbsp;aperture will show how beautifully one&nbsp;[bright] star, nearly opposite the great dark&nbsp;opening, is encompassed by a spiral mass of&nbsp;haze.”</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Robert Burnham, Jr., amplifies Webb's words in his <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Celestial Handbook</span><span class="font19">, writing,&nbsp;“On the east side [of the Orion Nebula] there&nbsp;are a few thicker and brighter filaments&nbsp;which curve southward in the direction of&nbsp;the bright star Iota Orionis; the most prominent of these is very clear even in a 6-inch&nbsp;glass. A huge arc of faint nebulosity continues outward from this area, turning back to&nbsp;the westward as it passes Iota, then curving north to join the main nebula again on&nbsp;the west side.” Iota Orionis, then, is near the&nbsp;apex of this vast loop, which measures some&nbsp;30 light-years wide.</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">NGC 1980 is in a selected list of Herschel's best 400 objects compiled by the Astronomical League, and some observers&nbsp;have seen it with binoculars: “The final&nbsp;binocular ‘sweep' of the night,” writes&nbsp;Massachusetts amateur Lew Gramer, who&nbsp;observed NGC 1980 in February 1999 with&nbsp;16 <span class="font5">× </span><span class="font19">70 mounted binoculars, “turned up a&nbsp;clear blob of unstructured haze, surrounding the beautiful bluish 3rd-magnitude&nbsp;star Iota Orionis. This otherwise featureless nebulosity was well separated from&nbsp;the swirling confusion of M42 but was&nbsp;slightly more noticeable north of bright&nbsp;Iota.”</span></p></td>
<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Anyone who has seen NGC 1980 through a telescope may have also noticed that Iota&nbsp;Ori,otherwiseknownasStruve752,isawon-derful triple star. The white sapphire primary is attended by a 7th-magnitude aquamarine companion 11<span class="font2"><sup>^^</sup> </span><span class="font19">to its southeast, and&nbsp;a 10th-magnitude star burns with a pale&nbsp;mango hue 49</span><span class="font2"><sup>^^</sup> </span><span class="font19">to the east and slightly south&nbsp;of Iota Ori. And there's more.</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">The region also sports two additional double stars: Struve 747, a pair of 5th-magnitude diamonds separated by 36<span class="font2"><sup>^^</sup></span><span class="font19">; and Struve 745,&nbsp;a pair of 9th-magnitude gems 29 </span><span class="font2"><sup>^^</sup> </span><span class="font19">apart. Iota&nbsp;and Struve 747 make a charming naked-eye&nbsp;double separated by 8</span><span class="font2"><sup>^</sup> </span><span class="font19">. If the coincidence&nbsp;of three multiple stars in a small region of&nbsp;space seems extraordinary, it's not, at least&nbsp;not in this case.</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">If you look at Iota Orionis and its surroundings carefully, you'll see that Iota is the brightest member of a 15<span class="font2"><sup>^</sup> </span><span class="font19">-wide cluster of 30 suns embedded in the milky haze&nbsp;of NGC 1980. Indeed, both the nebula and&nbsp;the cluster are part of the Orion Molecular Cloud Complex – a giant swath of&nbsp;interstellar gas and dust some 1,500 light-years distant, centered roughly on the Orion&nbsp;Nebula.</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;padding:0pt 0pt 8pt 0pt;">Since Herschel saw stars “involved” in the nebula, some claim he also discovered the&nbsp;cluster. Again, as with NGC 1977, that's a&nbsp;matter for interpretation. Consider this passage from Adm. William Henry Smyth's <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Cycle&nbsp;of Celestial Objects</span><span class="font19"> :</span></p>
<p class="font18" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:1pt;padding:0pt 0pt 0pt 9pt;">There is a glow about this object, when viewed under favouring circumstances; yet I cannot assert that the nebulosity in which it is&nbsp;enveloped is clearly seen. But under proper&nbsp;means it is well worth scrutiny; for nebulous&nbsp;stars are certainly among the most remark-ableobjectsintheheavensandperhapsshould&nbsp;be distinguished from stellar nebulae in being</p></td></tr></table><hr>

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;">Smyth's description of Iota being a nebulous star rather than a stellar nebula is most telling. The cluster embedded in NGC&nbsp;1980 went unnoticed until 1931, when Per&nbsp;Collinder published his seminal paper, “On&nbsp;structural properties of open galactic clusters and their spatial distribution.” Today&nbsp;the cluster carries the name Collinder 72 (Cr&nbsp;72), but don't bother looking for it on any&nbsp;popular star atlas. It's simply not plotted.&nbsp;For that reason, I call Cr 72 the Lost Jewel of&nbsp;Orion. Besides, the cluster's brightest stars&nbsp;form a pattern reminiscent of a large, pearshaped diamond set in a pendant that dangles from a gossamer necklace. Iota is the&nbsp;blinding glint of sunlight reflecting off one&nbsp;of the diamond's cleanly cut facets.</p></td>
<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;padding:0pt 0pt 14pt 0pt;">In a more piratical sense, Cr 72's distinct star pattern bears an uncanny resemblance&nbsp;to a hangman's noose tied to the crossbar&nbsp;of a gibbet at Execution Dock. For more&nbsp;than four centuries, pirates – such as Captain Kidd, John Gow, and other notorious&nbsp;felons – were hanged at Execution Dock,&nbsp;which was on the north bank of the Thames,&nbsp;a mile downstream from the Tower of London. “The gallows was set up on the shore&nbsp;near the low tide mark,” David Cordingly&nbsp;writes in <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Under the Black Flag.</span><span class="font19"> “After the&nbsp;pirates had been hanged, their bodies were&nbsp;slowly submerged by the swirling waters of&nbsp;the incoming tide.” With imagination, NGC&nbsp;1980, Webb's “spiral mass of haze,” can be&nbsp;seen as the swirling waters of the Thames&nbsp;lapping against the nefarious gallows&nbsp;(Cr 72).</span></p>
<p class="font5" style="text-align:justify;">THE NGC 1977 COMPLEX</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;">If you doubt M42 has the ability to draw attention away from other objects in the surrounding region, consider NGC 1977 (Hidden Treasure 32). This 6th-magnitude nebula lies only <span class="font17"><sup>1</sup><sub>2</sub> </span><span class="font2"><sup>◦</sup> </span><span class="font19">north of M42. And though&nbsp;NGC 1977 is one of the brightest objects in&nbsp;its class, the nebula was not noticed until&nbsp;1786, when William Herschel swept it up&nbsp;with his 18.7-inch f/13 speculum reflector.&nbsp;The keen-eyed observer cataloged it as a&nbsp;Class V object, meaning itisavery large nebula. (An explanation of the Roman numeral&nbsp;classes in William Herschel's system can be&nbsp;found on p. 5.</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Herschel also mentions that stars are involved with the nebula. In fact, a sparse&nbsp;cluster of about a dozen stars does exist here,&nbsp;and some catalogs prefer to list NGC 1977 as&nbsp;a cluster not a nebula. Since Herschel saw&nbsp;stars in the nebula, does that mean he also&nbsp;discovered the cluster?</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;padding:0pt 0pt 7pt 0pt;">Arguably, no. First, the stars would have been too sparse and spread out in Herschel's</p></td></tr></table><hr>

Second, the&nbsp;idea that stars would be involved with nebulosity was not extraordinary. Initially, Herschel believed that all nebulae resolved into&nbsp;stars, provided they were seen with a telescope of sufficient aperture and magnification. Later, after careful observation of&nbsp;numerous deep-sky objects, he reasoned&nbsp;that all of space must be filled with luminous&nbsp;matter totally unknown to us. This luminous&nbsp;matter (nebulae), he believed, would condense over time into smaller networks of&nbsp;shining clouds, which would then condense&nbsp;into </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">individual</span><span class="font19">, scattered stars. Under the&nbsp;influence of gravity, these individual stars&nbsp;would, again, over time, be attracted into&nbsp;</span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">clusters.</span><span class="font19">Finally,thelightgivenofffromthese&nbsp;clusters would eventually collect into diffuse clouds. And the cycle would repeat.</span></p></td>
<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Given this knowledge, how does NGC 1977 best fit into Herschel's evolutionary&nbsp;scheme? While it is likely that Herschel did&nbsp;see the stars that we now&nbsp;know belong to a galactic&nbsp;cluster, it is unclear whether&nbsp;he viewed them as a gravitationally bound system,&nbsp;especially since he does not&nbsp;mention which stars are&nbsp;involved in the nebula or&nbsp;how many there are. Consider Herschel's discovery&nbsp;observation of NGC 7076 in&nbsp;Cepheus. “A few [faint] stars&nbsp;with suspected nebulosity,&nbsp;with 300 many very [faint]&nbsp;stars intermixed with the&nbsp;former, so as to make a Cluster.” He listed this new object&nbsp;as a Class VII object (pretty&nbsp;much compressed clusters&nbsp;of large or small stars), not a nebula. Interestingly, it is not a cluster at all but a planetary nebula. Since Herschel does not mention the word “cluster” in his observation&nbsp;of NGC 1977, he must have perceived the&nbsp;nebula as being in the process of forming&nbsp;individual,scatteredstars,whichhadnotyet&nbsp;gathered under the influence of gravity into&nbsp;a cluster.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Herschel was a skilled observer, but he did not understand, the way we do today,&nbsp;the true nature of the objects he surveyed.&nbsp;Given the historical evidence, William Herschel discovered a nebula, not a cluster,&nbsp;and he classified it as such. Not until 1958&nbsp;were the stars associated with NGC 1977&nbsp;officially classified as a cluster (OCL 525.1).&nbsp;This poorly studied group is considered a&nbsp;cluster only because it is part of the Orion&nbsp;Molecular Cloud Complex – a giant cloud&nbsp;of interstellar gas and dust some 1,500&nbsp;light-years distant. This giant cloud is centered roughly on M42–M43 and includes</p></td></tr></table><hr>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;">NGC 1977, M78, Barnard's Loop, and the numerous&nbsp;bright and dark nebulae&nbsp;near Zeta Orionis (see Hidden Treasure 34). The cloud,&nbsp;which formed when a density&nbsp;wave triggered the collapse of&nbsp;gas and dust into hot young&nbsp;stars, measures several&nbsp;hundred light-years across.&nbsp;Collectively, this swath of&nbsp;new suns is known as the&nbsp;Orion <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">OB</span><span class="font19">1 Association.

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">NGC 1977 is fainter than the Orion Nebula and not as extensive. Still, it is a marvelous sight. A close pair of 5th-magnitude stars (42 and 45 Ori) reside in the nebula's&nbsp;brightest section. Johann Bayer (1572–1625)&nbsp;saw only one star here with the naked eye,&nbsp;which he labeled “c” on his famous <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Ura-nometria</span><span class="font19"> (1603) atlas. Galileo and other telescopic observers resolved the star into two&nbsp;components (c</span><span class="font17"><sup>1</sup> </span><span class="font19">and c</span><span class="font17"><sup>2</sup></span><span class="font19">), and John Flamsteed (1646–1719) relabeled them 42 and 45&nbsp;Ori, respectively. This explains the curious&nbsp;start to Herschel's discovery description of&nbsp;the object, “The 1st and 2nd c Orionis, and&nbsp;the stars about them,” and the 1888 </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">NGC&nbsp;</span><span class="font19">description, “</span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Remarkable</span><span class="font19">,c</span><span class="font17"><sup>1</sup> </span><span class="font19">42 Orionis and&nbsp;nebula (V 30).”</span></p></td>
<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Since 42 and 45 Ori are aligned with the nebula's major axis, it is difficult to differentiate between true nebulosity and the&nbsp;“fuzzy” nature of two dim stars seen close&nbsp;together with the unaided eye. Then again,&nbsp;I have seen several reports of observers seeing the nebula with the unaided eye, with&nbsp;some saying it is “easy.” No matter, the nebula is easy to detect in 7 <span class="font5">× </span><span class="font19">50 binoculars;&nbsp;through my antique telescope, the two 5th-magnitude stars look like car headlights&nbsp;emerging from a fog.</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Through the 4-inch at 23<span class="font5">×</span><span class="font19">, which gives a nearly 3</span><span class="font2"><sup>◦</sup> </span><span class="font19">field of view, NGC 1977 is a glorious network of nebulous fabric. It looks&nbsp;elegant, like wrinkled silk. At first the glow&nbsp;has a roughly uniform texture, but that&nbsp;illusion breaks down after spending any&nbsp;time with it. Discerning eyes should see&nbsp;NGC 1977 as three distinct, and near parallel, banks of bright nebulosity, sliced and&nbsp;separated by dark streams of obscuring&nbsp;matter. Pockets of glowing gas, like white&nbsp;foamed reefs, surround a half dozen or so&nbsp;of the region's brightest stars. Each has a&nbsp;tapered tail that, with imagination, appears&nbsp;to have been shaped by wind. Here we see&nbsp;the rugged terrain of a celestial starscape,&nbsp;one sculpted by the turbulent action of&nbsp;luminescent gas, which has been heated by a&nbsp;torrent of energetic ultraviolet light streaming from young hot stars for several million years. In color images, much of the&nbsp;northern and southern tracts of nebulosity shine with a pale sapphire sheen, evidence that starlight is being scattered by&nbsp;minute dust particles within the cloud. The&nbsp;central dust cloud wears a negligee of red&nbsp;light, indicating that strands of hydrogen&nbsp;gas have been excited by starlight to emit a&nbsp;rosy glow. Seen in another way, the bright&nbsp;patches of glowing gas, especially those&nbsp;around the brightest suns, look like spits of&nbsp;sand whose shoulders have been caressed&nbsp;by the constant flow of Orion's dark waters –&nbsp;the bleak and murky dark nebulae. These&nbsp;impressions are much more apparent when&nbsp;seen through a telescope. Photographs give&nbsp;a harsher impression, as if someone had&nbsp;attacked the “soft earth” of this nebula with&nbsp;a rake.</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Two of the light islands mentioned above have separate NGC numbers: 1973 and&nbsp;1975 (see photo). Heinrich Ludwig d'Arrest&nbsp;(1822–1875) discovered them both while at&nbsp;Copenhagen Observatory. He found NGC&nbsp;1973 on December 16, 1862, and NGC 1975&nbsp;on October 3, 1864. No doubt these objects&nbsp;stood out as separate objects from NGC 1977&nbsp;because of the telescope he used – the 11-inch f/17.5 Merz refractor. That telescope&nbsp;is a near twin of the 15-inch Merz refractor at Harvard College Observatory in Cambridge, Massachusetts, which I have used&nbsp;to survey the Orion Nebula and its environs. So I can say with confidence that large-aperture refractors with long focal lengths&nbsp;are notoriously blind to dim and extensive&nbsp;nebulae. Even at the lowest powers attainable, which hover around 180<span class="font5">×</span><span class="font19">, these fantastic instruments can magnify any tenuous&nbsp;sheen of a nebula to near invisibility. The&nbsp;eyepieces used with these scopes were the&nbsp;veryantithesisofthosewide-fieldonespop-ular today. Indeed, nineteenth-century eyepieces had infinitely small fields of view, so&nbsp;one could not fully appreciate the grandeur&nbsp;of a large nebula unless it was carefully&nbsp;studied, bit by bit, over the course of&nbsp;hours or days. Only the brightest sections&nbsp;of NGC 1977, then, would have stood out&nbsp;in d'Arrest's eyepiece as he swept the sky&nbsp;for nebulae. Considering that a thick dark&nbsp;lane also separates the brightest region of&nbsp;NGC 1977 (that to the south) from its dimmer northern half, it is not surprising that&nbsp;d'Arrest believed he had stumbled upon two&nbsp;new objects. Of course hehad simply picked&nbsp;out two bright regions within NGC 1977.</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">This fact is reflected in the 1888 <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">NGC </span><span class="font19">descriptions of NGC 1973 and NGC 1975:&nbsp;“Magnitude 8–9 star involved in a nebula&nbsp;(V 30),” and “bright double star involved in&nbsp;nebulosity ( V 30).” The “( V 30)” stands for&nbsp;William Herschel's H V-30, or NGC 1977. So,&nbsp;though these nebulae have separate NGC&nbsp;numbers, they are part of the same nebulous&nbsp;complex originally discovered by William&nbsp;Herschel. Note that many sources abbreviate the name of this complex by calling&nbsp;it either “1973</span><span class="font2"><sup>+</sup></span><span class="font19">,” or “1973,75,77.” But such&nbsp;designations are deceptive, because they&nbsp;make diminutive NGC 1973 the principal&nbsp;nebula instead of NGC 1977.</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Through the 4-inch, the main body of NGC 1973 appears as a circular patch,&nbsp;5<span class="font2"><sup>^</sup> </span><span class="font19">wide. It is associated with the variablestar&nbsp;KX Orionis and looks like the head of a comet&nbsp;just beginning to shine; with averted vision&nbsp;a stubby tail can be seen flowing to the east.&nbsp;NGC 1975 is a similar but much dimmer&nbsp;“comet” 5</span><span class="font2"><sup>^</sup> </span><span class="font19">northeast of NGC 1973. In a fanciful way it looks like the depiction of Halley's&nbsp;Comet in the famous Bayeaux Tapestry, having a round head, narrow neck, and broomlike appendage for a tail.</span></p></td></tr></table><hr>

Look for a dim, wedgeshaped cloud of glowing gas between the&nbsp;bright southern section of NGC 1977 (the&nbsp;part surrounding 42 and 45 Ori) and NGC&nbsp;1975. It is an extremely subtle expanse of&nbsp;milky light. This section of the nebula was&nbsp;probably too tenuous for d'Arrest to see.&nbsp;If you own a telescope that offers a wide&nbsp;field of view, be sure to use averted vision&nbsp;and sweep the telescope gently back and&nbsp;forth from east to west, then from north to&nbsp;south. The longer you do this, the better your&nbsp;chances are of seeing the extremely long filaments that stretch out to the west and east&nbsp;of the southern section of NGC 1977; the&nbsp;one to the east is bifurcated. The one to the&nbsp;west has a feathery texture. The northern&nbsp;section of the nebula also has long extensions, but only to the east. The west side,&nbsp;beyond NGC 1973,75, looks more rounded&nbsp;and ill defined. Seen together, these long&nbsp;tendrils give the nebula an uncanny resemblance to a skate egg case, otherwise known&nbsp;to beachcombers as the Mermaid's Purse,&nbsp;which is the name I have given to NGC 1977.&nbsp;The nebula's most common nickname, however, is The Running Man. It is based on&nbsp;the photographic impression of the dark&nbsp;nebulosity silhouetted against the glowing&nbsp;gas.

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">NGC 1999 is also a member of my own class of nebulae, which I call Dwarf Nebulae – bright nebulae measuring 10<span class="font2"><sup>^</sup> </span><span class="font19">or less&nbsp;in diameter; on some colored star atlases,&nbsp;such as Tirion's </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Sky Atlas 2000.0</span><span class="font19">, these tiny&nbsp;nebulae are displayed as thin green boxes&nbsp;about the size of a 4th-magnitude star.

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">NGC 1999 has a near claim to fame in the annals of astronomical history: in 1946–&nbsp;1947, the first three Herbig–Haro objects&nbsp;were discovered in images of NGC 1999.&nbsp;Herbig–Haro objects – named after independent discoverers George Herbig (University of California, Berkeley) and Mexican astronomer Guillermo – are small&nbsp;bright nebulae created in rich star-forming&nbsp;regions, where fast-moving jets of material ejected from very young stars collide&nbsp;with the interstellar medium. The collision&nbsp;of these jets with the surrounding gas generates strong shock waves, which move at&nbsp;speeds topping 100,000 miles an hour, exciting atoms along the way and causing the&nbsp;nebula to glow.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Indeed, NGC 1999 lies in the great starforming region known as the Orion dark cloud, or Orion A. It is a small but beautiful part of the much larger Orion Complex –&nbsp;a series of enormous clouds of interstellar gas and dust centered roughly on the&nbsp;Orion Nebula. In wide-field images taken&nbsp;with large telescopes and hydrogen-alpha&nbsp;light, tiny NGC 1999 (which measures about&nbsp;1light-yearinphysicalextent)issurrounded&nbsp;by a much more extensive, spade-shaped&nbsp;array of nebulous patches and filaments,&nbsp;all of which appear to be in a state of&nbsp;ordered chaos. The entire region, which&nbsp;could span 10 million light-years, is rife with&nbsp;bowshocks, marking the locations where&nbsp;vigorous stellar winds from young, hot&nbsp;stars slam into the surrounding interstellar&nbsp;medium.</p></td>

These “fingers” may, in fact, be visible indicators of fast winds ripping through&nbsp;the surrounding dust and gas as it blows outward from NGC 1999's core.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">That core, as imaged by the Hubble Space Telescope in January 2000, shows a devil-ishlydarkcloud,resemblingarubberstamp,&nbsp;silhouetted against the brilliant reflection&nbsp;nebula. The dust comprising that dark mass,&nbsp;called Parsamian 34, is so dense that it&nbsp;blocks the light behind it just as a dense&nbsp;cloud here on Earth will hide a full Moon&nbsp;from view. While Parsamian 34 dominates&nbsp;the view in the HST image, it actually&nbsp;obscures only a small portion of the visible&nbsp;nebula.</p>

Still, I was somewhat surprised at how easy it was to see. The few sources that mention NGC 1999&nbsp;as a target for amateur observation mention that a 6-inch is required to see it. I&nbsp;believe the problem is one of proper magnification. Dwarf nebulae, especially those&nbsp;like NGC 1999, which have a relatively bright&nbsp;star associated with them, require substantial magnification.

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">The brow's east-northeastern side appears beaded or mottled. Though fainter,&nbsp;the details here are a near mirror image of&nbsp;those in the northeastern brow. A tiny knot&nbsp;lies due south of V380 Ori and a dimmer&nbsp;one lies on the west-southwest flank of the&nbsp;brow. The principal difference in the two&nbsp;brows is that the northern one is broad and&nbsp;uniform, while the southwestern one is&nbsp;highly serrated, with tiny rays shooting off&nbsp;to the west and southwest. Also, a broader&nbsp;and fainter ray can be seen extending from&nbsp;thesouthern knot to the southeast. All these&nbsp;details are hyper fine and require a lot of&nbsp;patience to see. But they are apparent under&nbsp;different magnifications. Also, you need&nbsp;goodatmosphericstability. If you do not see&nbsp;the rays on one night, try again on another.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">As for the dark obscuring cloud, Parsamian 34, it lies about 15<span class="font2"><sup>^^</sup> </span><span class="font19">westsouthwest of V380 Ori. I could not see&nbsp;it directly; it's arguable though, that one&nbsp;could infer its presence from the absence&nbsp;of nebulosity in that region in my drawing.&nbsp;Christian Luginbuhl and Brian Skiff definitely saw the dark bay in a 10-inch, and&nbsp;recorded the full “T” or “rubber stamp”&nbsp;in a drawing based on views through the&nbsp;42-inch reflector at Lowell Observatory.</span></p></td>
<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">By the way, Parsamian 34 is an example of a Bok globule – a small cloud of cold&nbsp;gas, molecules, and cosmic dust, named&nbsp;after the late Harvard College Observatory&nbsp;astronomer Bart J. Bok who proposed in the&nbsp;late 1940s that such clouds may be stellar&nbsp;nurseries. Bok argued that these diminutive nebulae, which span less than 10,000&nbsp;astronomical units, were once attached to&nbsp;umbilical filaments of neutral hydrogen gas.&nbsp;Radiation from nearby stars separated, then&nbsp;compressed, them, and the orphaned dark&nbsp;clouds continued to contract under their&nbsp;own gravity until they formed the tiny globules we see today. Keith Noll, an astronomer&nbsp;at the Space Telescope Science Institute in&nbsp;Maryland, notes that Parsamian 34 probably has enough mass to form one or two&nbsp;stars.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">The story behind the creation of each Bok globule is like that of the legendary black&nbsp;pearl. According to Tahitian mythology, the&nbsp;black pearl illuminated the heavens and was&nbsp;used by gods to create the firmament of&nbsp;bright stars. Today these precious gems are&nbsp;found only in black-lipped oysters. And as&nbsp;with Bok globules, the luster of a Tahitian&nbsp;black pearl can reveal Nature's deepest mysteries.</p></td></tr></table><hr><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"><img src="Hidden Treasures_files/Hidden Treasures-152.jpg" style="width:389pt;height:508pt;"/></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;">

<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">To find this remarkable nebula just point your telescope to Alnitak, which is from&nbsp;the Arabic word, <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Al Nitak</span><span class="font19">, meaning “The&nbsp;Girdle.” Before you go any further, stop,&nbsp;and pay tribute to one of the sky's finest&nbsp;triple stars in the heavens. Alnitak, though&nbsp;it might appear singular in appearance, is a&nbsp;close double star – a magnitude 1.9 primary&nbsp;with a magnitude 3.4 secondary 2.6</span><span class="font2"><sup>^^</sup> </span><span class="font19">to the&nbsp;southeast. A third companion, shining at&nbsp;magnitude 9.5, lies 57</span><span class="font2"><sup>^^</sup> </span><span class="font19">northeast of the&nbsp;primary. Thomas W. Webb said the primary&nbsp;pair were “of some nondescript hue, about&nbsp;which observers do not agree.” But this&nbsp;is not totally the case. For instance, Adm.&nbsp;William Henry Smyth saw the primary as&nbsp;“topaz yellow” and the secondary as “light&nbsp;purple,” William Tyler Olcott saw them&nbsp;as “yellow and blue,” Richard H. Allen&nbsp;records them as “topaz yellow and purple,”&nbsp;and I see them as topaz and rose. Then&nbsp;again, Ernst J. Hartung (1893–1979) calls&nbsp;them a “brilliant white pair,” and F. G. Wilhelm Struve calls the secondary </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">“olivacea&nbsp;subrubicunda,”</span><span class="font19"> which means “slightly&nbsp;reddish-olive.”</span></p></td></tr></table><hr>
<table cellpadding="7pt">

<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Although the primary can be resolved in a 2-inch telescope, William Herschel did not&nbsp;note them. My guess is that either his discovery of NGC 2024 and its “[w]onderful black&nbsp;space” whisked his attention away from that&nbsp;bright star, or the seeing was terrible on&nbsp;that discovery night. Regardless, Alnitak's&nbsp;duplicity went unnoticed until 1819, when&nbsp;the German amateur astronomer Georg&nbsp;Karl Friedrich Kunowsky (1786–1846) first&nbsp;resolved the star in a 4.5-inch Fraunhofer&nbsp;refractor.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Without question, the only reason NGC 2024 is a hidden treasure is because of its&nbsp;close proximity to a bright star. Had the nebula been farther away from its bright companion, it would have not only been discovered sooner but also would have become&nbsp;an object as popular as M42–M43. But don't&nbsp;be deceived by NGC 2024's listed magnitude&nbsp;(7.2),whichIdeterminedunderdarkHawai-ian skies. You have to imagine the light of a&nbsp;7th-magnitude star spread out over an area&nbsp;the size of the full Moon. Yet, at least under&nbsp;a dark sky, I have seen it clearly with 7 <span class="font5">× </span><span class="font19">50&nbsp;binoculars, especially if I occult Alnitak with&nbsp;a distant rooftop or some other sharp-edged&nbsp;structure – natural or otherwise.</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Telescopically Webb calls NGC 2024 a “[f]aint but extensive” nebula; he also notes&nbsp;that Heinrich d'Arrest resolved it into four&nbsp;large patches. Other sources claim that the&nbsp;nebula is difficult to observe because of&nbsp;its proximity to Zeta Ori. But such phrases&nbsp;underestimate how easy and wonderful this&nbsp;object can appear under the right conditions. Yes, if you are an observer who simply wants to see and move on, NGC 2024&nbsp;may be nothing more than a splash of dim&nbsp;nebulosity whose light is overpowered by&nbsp;a very bright star. But I have yet to be in&nbsp;the field with amateur astronomers who&nbsp;did not gasp at the glory of NGC 2024 –&nbsp;especially those using nebula and H-beta&nbsp;filters.</p></td>
<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">In a rich-field telescope, the nebula's core is, actually, quite bright, and its dark&nbsp;lane quite distinguishable. In fact, the view&nbsp;through the 4-inch f/5 Genesis is outstanding. One clear winter's evening in 2003, I&nbsp;logged that I “[n]ever knew so much detail&nbsp;could be seen.” In fact, when studied at&nbsp;all magnifications, the nebula and its most&nbsp;intricate details can be detected with just&nbsp;a little patience. Through larger scopes,&nbsp;hardly any effort is required at all to see the&nbsp;black girdle ribs ripping through the glowing gas, separating it into five distinct sections. Each section I have also seen in the&nbsp;4-inch, though it takes some concentration&nbsp;and careful study.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">The brightest segments of the cloud lie on either side of the north–south-oriented&nbsp;dark lane. The slightly brighter eastern side&nbsp;is further segmented by at least three thin&nbsp;dark lanes, which extend radially from the&nbsp;main girdle like ribs from a breast bone.&nbsp;Another bit of tenuous nebulosity wafts ever&nbsp;so slighty to the east – it being separated&nbsp;from the chest of light by yet another north–&nbsp;south-oriented lane of dust. A line of three&nbsp;telescopic stars lie along the eastern edge of&nbsp;the black sternum. The northernmost star&nbsp;shines the brightest and the southernmost&nbsp;one looks the faintest.</p>

But under a dark&nbsp;sky with a large telescope, NGC 2024 comes&nbsp;alive. One memorable view came in January 1990, during my first visit to the Winter Star Party, which is held each year in&nbsp;the Florida Keyes. One night Jack Newton,&nbsp;the renowned Canadian astro-imager, took&nbsp;command of an 18-inch Dobsonian reflector owned by WSP founder Tippy d'Auria,&nbsp;and said he wanted to “tease me” with some&nbsp;sights. He then placed the scope on NGC&nbsp;2024, which he called the Tank Tracks Nebula. But I saw something different. There in&nbsp;full glory was the imprint of someone's lips&nbsp;on the crystalline sphere of the heavens. A&nbsp;casual scan of the nebula showed all manner of delicate wisps and knots of bright&nbsp;nebulosity interspersed with the intricate&nbsp;folds of obscuring dust. It was as if someone&nbsp;had spilled oil in water and stirred it with a&nbsp;stick – a perfect introduction to what was to&nbsp;become a week of celestial wonder.</p></td>

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;">As you might imagine, NGC 2024 has many names: Tank Tracks Nebula, Lips Nebula,&nbsp;Flame Nebula, Burning Bush Nebula, and&nbsp;more. But in preparation for this book, I&nbsp;decided to call it One Piece – for the legendary treasure left behind by the Pirate&nbsp;King (Gold Roger) in the Japanese <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Manga<a name="footnote5"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark93">5</a></sup></span><span class="font17"><sup>&nbsp;</sup></span><span class="font19">by that name. In “One Piece,” Gold Roger&nbsp;dies. But just before he does, he reveals that&nbsp;he has buried all his treasure in “one piece”&nbsp;somewhere on the Grand Line – a legendary&nbsp;oceansaidtobesodangerousthatitissome-times referred to as the Pirates' Graveyard.&nbsp;In the spirit of the One Piece, then, you can&nbsp;sail across the Pirates' Graveyard (the region&nbsp;around Alnitak) and be on the lookout for&nbsp;Five Ghosts – NGC 2023, IC 435, IC 431,&nbsp;IC 432, and IC 434 – and the Grim Reaper's&nbsp;Horse – Barnard 33. Two things will help&nbsp;your search, averted vision and magnification once the sites are located.<sup><a href="#bookmark93">5</a></sup></span><span class="font17"><sup></sup></span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Start with NGC 2023, the brightest of the lot. It lies about 20<span class="font2"><sup>^</sup> </span><span class="font19">southeast of Alni-tak. Look for a 10</span><span class="font2"><sup>^</sup> </span><span class="font19">-wide glow circling an&nbsp;8th-magnitude star. While the glow might&nbsp;appear uniformly round, there's some fine&nbsp;wispy structure to it, especially to the&nbsp;southeast. You'll find IC 435 about 20</span><span class="font2"><sup>^</sup> </span><span class="font19">east of&nbsp;NGC 2023. This bright reflection nebula&nbsp;hugs a 9th-magnitude star. Although it is&nbsp;only 4</span><span class="font2"><sup>^</sup> </span><span class="font19">in diameter, it too should be easy&nbsp;to spot with magnification. Now return to&nbsp;Alnitak. If you sail about 25</span><span class="font2"><sup>^</sup> </span><span class="font19">north you'll&nbsp;find a 7th-magnitude star surrounded by a&nbsp;5</span><span class="font2"><sup>^</sup> </span><span class="font19">glow; that's IC 432. IC 431 is a much more&nbsp;challenging glow, 8</span><span class="font2"><sup>^</sup> </span><span class="font19">in diameter, about 12</span><span class="font2"><sup>^&nbsp;</sup></span><span class="font19">to the west-northwest. Look for a close pair&nbsp;of stars (magnitudes 7.0 and 7.7); IC 431 surrounds the dimmer, southeasternmost star&nbsp;in the pair.</span></p></td></tr></table><hr>

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Before discussing our fifth ghost, IC 434, swing your telescope over to 4th-magnitude&nbsp;Sigma (<span class="font5">^</span><span class="font19">) Orionis, just 50</span><span class="font2"><sup>^</sup> </span><span class="font19">southwest of Alni-tak. Sigma Ori is a multiple star of unfathomable depths. Admiral Smyth called it a&nbsp;“fine group of 10 members” that includes a&nbsp;double-triple star. The 4th-magnitude primary has a 5th-magnitude companion 0.3</span><span class="font2"><sup>^^&nbsp;</sup></span><span class="font19">away to the east-southeast, so you will need&nbsp;a large telescope to split it. I see 11 stars&nbsp;in the immediate area in the 4-inch. The&nbsp;brightest ones form a linear quadruple (the&nbsp;Sigma system) and a slender triangle of 8th-magnitude stars (Struve 761) just 210</span><span class="font2"><sup>^^</sup> </span><span class="font19">to the&nbsp;northwest.SinceStruve761sharesthesame&nbsp;motion through space as the Sigma system,&nbsp;all must be a little moving cluster. Do you&nbsp;suspect a slight fog around Sigma?</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">The fifth ghost, IC 434, is a long reef of dim nebulosity in our legendary ocean. The&nbsp;reef begins at Alnitak and runs for more than&nbsp;1<span class="font2"><sup>◦</sup> </span><span class="font19">south-southeastward. It includes what is&nbsp;arguably the most famous, if not the most&nbsp;telescopically desired, dark nebulae of all –&nbsp;Barnard 33, the Horsehead Nebula, our&nbsp;hooded Grim Reaper. Seeing IC 434 is no&nbsp;challenge. Larry Krumenaker in New Jersey&nbsp;observeditina2.4-inchrefractorintheearly&nbsp;1980s. But seeing the Horsehead is another&nbsp;matter. It may be the most challenging popular object to see in the heavens. Still, the&nbsp;late, famous comet discoverer and variable&nbsp;star observer Leslie Peltier (Delphos, Ohio)&nbsp;saw the Horsehead in a 6-inch refractor;&nbsp;Walter Scott Houston glimpsed it with a 4-inch Clark refractor; and a group of four&nbsp;amateurs sighted it with Snow's 4-inch off-axis reflector.</span></p></td>
<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Some observers have mistaken the dark girdle in NGC 2024 for the Horsehead, which&nbsp;is easy to imagine, especially if you get&nbsp;your mental compass turned around. Some&nbsp;observers, enamored with the Horsehead's&nbsp;magnified appearance in images, go searching for something much larger than it really&nbsp;is and expect to see the Horse's mane and&nbsp;pointed face. The fact is, the Horsehead is&nbsp;a tiny notch of darkness halfway down the&nbsp;sharp and straight eastern fringe of IC 434.&nbsp;The Horsehead Nebula spans only about 5<span class="font2"><sup>^</sup> </span><span class="font19">,&nbsp;and its appearance in small telescopes is&nbsp;one that looks more like a faded thumbprint&nbsp;than a horse's head.</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Knowing exactly where to look and using averted vision are the keys to seeing it. If&nbsp;you have located NGC 2023 and the 7th-magnitude sun it surrounds, you are within&nbsp;striking distance of the Horsehead. Just look&nbsp;for another 7th-magnitude star about 10<span class="font2"><sup>^&nbsp;</sup></span><span class="font19">to the west-southwest. The Horsehead is&nbsp;almost 10</span><span class="font2"><sup>^</sup> </span><span class="font19">due south of it. The sharp eastern&nbsp;wall of IC 434 runs right past that star. The&nbsp;Horsehead is simply a west-facing notch in&nbsp;the wall.</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">The irony is that I have had more difficulty seeing the Horsehead Nebula in an 18-inch&nbsp;reflector without an H-beta filter than I have&nbsp;in seeing it in a 4-inch rich-field telescope&nbsp;at low power without a filter. The fact is, low</p><div style="border-bottom:solid;display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"><img src="Hidden Treasures_files/Hidden Treasures-156.jpg" style="width:179pt;height:275pt;"/></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all">
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;">power concentrates the light ofIC 434, making the silhouette of B33 more obvious than at higher powers, which magnifies the dim&nbsp;light and thereby reduces the apparent contrast. Of course, if you have a nebular filter,&nbsp;especially an H-beta filter, which transmits&nbsp;nebular light from the hydrogen-beta (H<span class="font5">^</span><span class="font19">)&nbsp;emission line, the Horsehead can be seen in&nbsp;hand-held binoculars.</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">At first I liked to call the Horsehead Nebula the Grim Reaper because I've heard amateurs often say that, “Looking for the&nbsp;Horsehead Nebula will be the death of me.”&nbsp;Besides, with imagination, the dark nebula&nbsp;could be seen as the head and shoulders of&nbsp;the Death figure with its ominous hood. But&nbsp;I've since changed my mind. You see, one&nbsp;of the earliest mythological renderings of&nbsp;the Grim Reaper appears in Geoffroy Tory's&nbsp;1525 <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Horae</span><span class="font19">, which shows a skeleton holding a scythe and an hourglass while riding&nbsp;a </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">black horse.</span><span class="font19"> So now I see B33 as the head&nbsp;of the Grim Reaper's black horse. Besides,&nbsp;who wants to see the Grim Reaper, anyway?&nbsp;As legend has it, whoever eyes that shadowy figure will . . . well, let's just leave it at&nbsp;that!</span></p></td></tr></table><hr><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"><img src="Hidden Treasures_files/Hidden Treasures-157.jpg" style="width:389pt;height:508pt;"/></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;">

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;">Orion harbors a wealth of celestial treasures. It is especially rich in&nbsp;bright nebulae, including the curious reflection nebula NGC 2163. Not many observers&nbsp;have seen it – not because they can't, but&nbsp;because they do not know it exists. Until&nbsp;recently, NGC 2163 was one of the hundreds&nbsp;of objects classified as “non-existent” in the&nbsp;1973 <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Revised New General Catalogue.</span><span class="font19"> But&nbsp;NGC 2163 does exist, and it's a fine object&nbsp;for small telescopes.

<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Edouard Jean-Marie Stephan (1837–1923) discovered this tiny (3<span class="font2"><sup>^</sup> </span><span class="font5">× </span><span class="font19">2</span><span class="font2"><sup>^</sup></span><span class="font19">) wonder with the&nbsp;31-inch reflector at Marseilles Observatory&nbsp;in France. It was one of several discoveries&nbsp;he had made with that telescope between&nbsp;1870 and 1884. In 1887 Stephan sent this list&nbsp;to John Louis Emile Dreyer, who was collecting data for the </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">New General Catalogue&nbsp;</span><span class="font19">(</span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">NGC</span><span class="font19">), which was to be published the following year. Perhaps in haste, Dreyer mistakenly attributed the declination of NGC&nbsp;1741, a galaxy in Eridanus, to NGC 2163.&nbsp;Dreyer did amend the mistake in his second </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Index Catalogue</span><span class="font19"> (in the Notes and Corrections section), but the error carried on&nbsp;into the future for one simple reason: the&nbsp;</span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Revised New General Catalogue</span><span class="font19"> (</span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">RNGC</span><span class="font19">) –&nbsp;which became a main source of data in&nbsp;modern catalogs; unfortunately it excluded&nbsp;the two </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Index Catalogues</span><span class="font19"> and so, the error&nbsp;of NGC 2163's declination remained unaltered.

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">The problem was solved when Brian Skiff recomputed Stephan's original&nbsp;position using precise coordinates for his offset star.&nbsp;What he discovered was</p><div style="float:right;layout-flow:horizontal;"><img src="Hidden Treasures_files/Hidden Treasures-159.jpg" style="width:255pt;height:198pt;"/></div>

In that work, Cederblad uses Dreyer's&nbsp;corrected position of NGC 2163. “Besides&nbsp;the excellent positional match,” Skiff notes,&nbsp;“Stephan describedNGC 2163 as ‘elongated&nbsp;with [a magnitude 11 star] attached south.'&nbsp;And visually this nebula appears to extend&nbsp;more prominently north of the magnitude&nbsp;11.5 (central) star.” So there is no doubt&nbsp;that Cederblad 62, which appears on several modern star atlases, is, in fact, Stephan's&nbsp;long, lost NGC 2163.</span></p></td>

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">In high-resolution images, NGC 2163 is an interesting bipolar nebula with two&nbsp;symmetrical funnel-shaped jets extending&nbsp;north–south from the central star. The&nbsp;star near the nebular apex is the 13th-magnitude irregularly variable emissionline star, LkHa208, which happens to be a&nbsp;fairly erratic young star of the UX Orionis&nbsp;type. NGC 2163 is a young star with strong&nbsp;bipolar winds that are interacting with the&nbsp;material surrounding the star. Light from&nbsp;the star is being reflected from this material&nbsp;producing two symmetrical funnel-shaped&nbsp;optical lobes. The entire object is still partially embedded within it's prenatal molecular cloud, part of which we happen toseeas&nbsp;the dark nebula LDN 1574, explaining why&nbsp;the nebula's southern lobe appears more&nbsp;obscured than it's northern counterpart.</p>

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;">ngc 2169 is a beautiful and bright open star cluster in the northern reaches of Orion. The once overlooked&nbsp;Italian astronomer Giovanni Batista&nbsp;Hodierna arguably sighted it before William&nbsp;Herschel. In his 1654 <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">De Admirandi Coeli&nbsp;Caracteribus</span><span class="font19">, Hodierna lists an object in&nbsp;Orion's Right Arm that appears nebulous&nbsp;to the naked eye but resolves into stars&nbsp;in a telescope. And while the description&nbsp;seems vague, there is only one object in that&nbsp;location that would resolve into an obvious&nbsp;cluster in a simple Galilean refractor at&nbsp;20 </span><span class="font5">×</span><span class="font19">– the 6th-magnitude open star cluster&nbsp;NGC 2169. And while the nearby star cluster&nbsp;NGC 2194 is a much more popular object&nbsp;for observers with 8-inch and larger telescopes, it shines at magnitude 8.5, which&nbsp;is clearly too faint to see with the naked&nbsp;eye, nor would it be a resolved cluster in an&nbsp;antique scope at low power. But NGC 2169&nbsp;is visible to the naked eye and its brightest&nbsp;stars appear as a trapezoid of tightly knit&nbsp;suns in my antique refractor; it looks like&nbsp;a magnified view of M42's Trapezium&nbsp;cluster without the nebulosity. So I have no&nbsp;doubt that Hodierna discovered this fine&nbsp;object.</span></p></td>

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">While some might argue that Hodierna could not possibly have noticed the 6<span class="font2"><sup>^</sup> </span><span class="font19">-wide&nbsp;cluster as a hazy spot with the naked eye, he&nbsp;didn't have to.

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:9pt;padding:0pt 0pt 0pt 8pt;">This 6th-magnitude gem is easy to find. Just raise your&nbsp;binoculars about 35<span class="font2"><sup>^</sup> </span><span class="font19">southwest of the midpoint between&nbsp;Xi and Nu Ori (which comprise Orion's right hand). You&nbsp;should immediately see a&nbsp;tight double star centered in&nbsp;a fine mist.

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">In a 2001 American Astronomical Society paper, C. Yost and his colleagues from Appalachian State University determined&nbsp;that NGC 2169 is 15 million years young. The&nbsp;cluster is similar in age to NGC 1502 (Hidden Treasure 23) and NGC 663 (Caldwell&nbsp;10), which are 5 and 9 million years young,&nbsp;respectively. Most of NGC 2169's stars are of&nbsp;spectral type <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">A</span><span class="font19">3 or younger, though a possible population of pre-main-sequence members could be present. Yost also notes a lack&nbsp;of nebulosity, either bright or dark, associated with it – a curiosity first reported in 1955&nbsp;by J. Cuffey (Goethe Link Observatory) and&nbsp;S. McCuskey ( Warner and Swasey Observatory). Apparently the dust and gas were used&nbsp;up most efficiently during the process of star&nbsp;formation, leaving very little for the interstellar medium.</span></p></td>

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;">shine like glitter on a gift box. The cluster's 30-odd members are separated into two distinct groups of bright stars – one to&nbsp;the northwest, the other to the southeast.&nbsp;A bright pair of stars can be distinguished&nbsp;in each group and they are oriented nearly&nbsp;perpendicular to one another – sort of like&nbsp;the Double Double in Lyra. With magnification and south up, each pair can be seen in&nbsp;a group of stars shaped like the lower case&nbsp;Greek letter lambda (<span class="font5">^</span><span class="font19">). The northwestern&nbsp;lambda is short and squat; the southeastern&nbsp;lambda is long and lean. These groupings&nbsp;are so bright, they should be a cinch to see&nbsp;from city skies.</span></p>

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">You need only a little imagination to see NGC 2169's box-like arrangement as the&nbsp;Trapezium (and its attendant stars) in M42,&nbsp;but greatly magnified. The cluster can also&nbsp;be viewed as a Little Pleiades. But NGC 2169&nbsp;already has a great nickname – the Shopping Cart; and once you see the cluster in&nbsp;that way, there's no getting the vision out&nbsp;of your head. I suppose it could also be&nbsp;called the Baby Carriage, but that's up to&nbsp;you and what you want to see. For instance,&nbsp;the cluster is also known as the 37 Cluster,&nbsp;because the stars seem to spell out “37.”&nbsp;The name originates from Alan Goldstein,&nbsp;in the 1981 March–April issue of <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Betelgeuse</span><span class="font19">,&nbsp;the official newsletter of the National DeepSky Observers Society.</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:9pt;padding:0pt 0pt 9pt 0pt;">Larger telescopes will certainly show a greater background field. But I do not&nbsp;applaud the number of stars in NGC&nbsp;2169 only its simplicity. Admiral William&nbsp;H. Smyth was particularly touched by the&nbsp;cluster, whose beauty and wonder caused&nbsp;him to ponder the very creation of the&nbsp;universe:</p>
<p class="font18" style="text-align:justify;padding:0pt 0pt 9pt 9pt;">These gatherings occurring indifferently upon the Via Lactea [Milky Way] and off it, awaken&nbsp;still more our admiration of the stupendous&nbsp;richness of the Universe, in every department&nbsp;of which there appears such a profusion of creation, if we may so express ourselves of the&nbsp;works of the ALMIGHTY, in which our utmost&nbsp;ken has yet never detected any redundancy,&nbsp;much less anything made in vain.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;padding:0pt 0pt 9pt 0pt;">Then again, I was surprised to read these words by WalterScottHouston:“Were[NGC&nbsp;2169] not already in the NGC, I would never&nbsp;have recognized it as a cluster.” Such is the&nbsp;way of human opinion, no matter what one&nbsp;feels, it is justified.</p></td></tr></table><hr><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"><img src="Hidden Treasures_files/Hidden Treasures-165.jpg" style="width:389pt;height:512pt;"/></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all">

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">NGC 2175 is a diffuse nebula discovered by Carl Christian Bruhns (1830–1881) around 1857, apparently while searching&nbsp;for comets with a small comet sweeper at&nbsp;BerlinObservatory.It's possible that the Italian astronomer Giovanni Batista Hodierna&nbsp;discovered it with a simple Galilean refractor and 20<span class="font5">× </span><span class="font19">sometime before 1654, though&nbsp;his description appears to be insufficient.&nbsp;Arthur Auwers first reported it as the 21st&nbsp;object in his list of new nebulae in William&nbsp;Herschel's </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Verzeichnisse von Nebelflecken&nbsp;und Sternhaufen</span><span class="font19"> (Ko¨ nigsberg, 1862). John&nbsp;Herschel included it in his </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">General Catalogue</span><span class="font19"> as GC 1366, which later became NGC&nbsp;2175. “So clearly,” write Brent Archinal and&nbsp;Steven Hynes in their book </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Star Clusters</span><span class="font19">,&nbsp;“the name NGC 2175 should be assigned to&nbsp;the nebula only.”</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Archinal and Hynes do note, however, that a possible cluster was discovered here by Per&nbsp;Collinder, who included it in his 1931 paper&nbsp;“On structural properties of open galactic&nbsp;clusters and their spatial distribution.” Ifthe&nbsp;cluster exists, its designation is Collinder&nbsp;84. “The reality of the cluster itself is in&nbsp;some doubt,” say Archinal and Hynes. “An&nbsp;examination of it visually or on the [Digital&nbsp;Sky Survey] shows a fairly low star density&nbsp;and no obvious cluster involved with the&nbsp;NGC nebula.” IfNGC 2175 isthe nebula and&nbsp;Collinder 84 is a possible cluster, what then&nbsp;is NGC 2174? It is a small wisp of nebulosity&nbsp;in the northern part of the larger complex&nbsp;that Jean Marie Edouard Stephan IX discovered.

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Today we recognize NGC 2175 to be a part of Sharpless 2–252, an extended H-II region&nbsp;in the direction of the galactic anticenter. If&nbsp;we accept NGC 2175's distance to be 7,200&nbsp;light-years, it extends some 84 <span class="font5">× </span><span class="font19">64 light-years in true physical extent, which makes&nbsp;it about twice as extensive as the Great Orion&nbsp;Nebula well to its south. Had NGC 2175 been&nbsp;at the distance of M42, it would cover more&nbsp;than 3</span><span class="font2"><sup>◦</sup> </span><span class="font19">of sky and shine at 5th magnitude.&nbsp;The H-II region is excited mainly by the&nbsp;magnitude 7.6 star HD 420888 (spectral type&nbsp;</span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">O</span><span class="font19"> 6.5V ) atthe nebula's heart.</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Several papers in professional journals discuss the stars apparently associated with&nbsp;the H-II region. As early as 1970, P. Pis-mis divided the stellar region into two&nbsp;groups, which are now commonly called&nbsp;NGC 2175main and NGC 2175small – but,&nbsp;as Archinal and Hynes point out, these&nbsp;should be called Collinder 84main and&nbsp;Collinder 84small. Pismis argued that&nbsp;Collinder 84small, “which lies in the northeast corner of the ionized region, has a distance of 10,000 light-years, and, therefore is&nbsp;more distant than Collinder 84main.” But&nbsp;a more recent survey of the region by German astronomer L. K. Haikala (Max-PlankInstitute for Astronomy), which is published&nbsp;in a 1995 <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Astronomy and Astrophysics</span><span class="font19"> paper,&nbsp;shows that Collinder 84main and Collinder&nbsp;84small are indeed at the same distance and&nbsp;are therefore probably associated with the&nbsp;same molecular cloud, though they formed&nbsp;at different epochs. Collinder 84main is&nbsp;about 1 million years young – about as young&nbsp;astheTrapeziumclusterintheOrionNebula&nbsp;– while Collinder 84small is on the order of&nbsp;10 million years young. Star formation inthe&nbsp;region, then, has been going on until quite&nbsp;recently.</span></p></td>

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;">ngc 2264 is an extremely bright and extremely obvious open star cluster in&nbsp;Monoceros – one visible to the naked eye&nbsp;and well resolved in binoculars. Miraculously, it escaped the gaze of every observational astronomer until 1784, when William&nbsp;Herschel chanced upon it during one of his&nbsp;sweeps for new celestial objects. To this day,&nbsp;NGC 2264 is greatly overshadowed by its&nbsp;equally stunning neighbor NGC 2237–8,46,&nbsp;the renowned Rosette Nebula (Caldwell 49),&nbsp;and its associated open cluster NGC 2244&nbsp;(Caldwell 50). Even the diminutive, but&nbsp;exceedingly interesting, NGC 2261, Hubble's Variable Nebula (Caldwell 46), made it&nbsp;into Patrick Moore's Caldwell list. But NGC&nbsp;2264 did not. The irony: to find Hubble's&nbsp;Variable Nebula, most observers star hop to&nbsp;it from 5th-magnitude 15 Monocerotis, the&nbsp;head of Monoceros, the mythical Unicorn,&nbsp;and brightest star in NGC 2264. For these&nbsp;reasons, NGC 2264 is one of the classic&nbsp;hidden treasures.</p></td>
<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">When William Herschel discovered the cluster on January 18, 1784, he did not&nbsp;notice any nebulosity. But when he encountered this coarse scattering of stars again&nbsp;on December 26, 1785, he noticed that they&nbsp;“are involved with extremely faint milky&nbsp;nebulosity which loses itself imperceptibly.”&nbsp;He cataloged the nebula (H V-27) sepa-ratelyfromthecluster(HVIII-5).Thehistory&nbsp;behind these objects got lost when William's&nbsp;son John decided to list the cluster and the&nbsp;nebula under a single listing (h 401) in his&nbsp;original observations, and as GC 1140 in his&nbsp;1864 <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">General Catalogue of Nebulae</span><span class="font19">.

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">TodayweknowtheChristmasTreeCluster and the “faint milky nebulosity” is only part&nbsp;of a much larger star-forming region some&nbsp;3 to 30 million years young. The Christmas&nbsp;Tree Cluster alone extends across more than&nbsp;30 light-years of space. If this region dates&nbsp;to 3 million years, it was born when tectonic forces formedthe Dead Sea (the lowest&nbsp;point on Earth), and when a female hominid&nbsp;we've named “Lucy” hit the ground walking (on two legs instead of four) in the Lae-toli plains of northern Tanzania. If the starforming region dates to 30 million years,&nbsp;then it emerged just as the first humming-birdsbegansavoringnectarintheflowersof&nbsp;Europe.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">In long-exposure color photographs and CCD images, the cluster is surrounded by a&nbsp;symphony of nebulosity whose bright and&nbsp;dark folds seem to ripple across space like&nbsp;visible sound waves. The brightest clouds,&nbsp;which hug S Mon are a fascinating mixture of red fluorescent hydrogen and dark,&nbsp;obscuring dust lanes, some of which are&nbsp;close enough to bright stars to scatter blue&nbsp;light. Some of the wispy tendrils of nebulosity are Herbig–Haro objects, jets of matter&nbsp;ejected from newly formed stars still hidden within the nebula. Indeed, while about&nbsp;250, mainly Type <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">O</span><span class="font19"> and </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">B</span><span class="font19">, stars can be&nbsp;seen populating this bubbling cauldron of&nbsp;vapors, around 360 near-infrared sources&nbsp;are believed to be forming an embedded&nbsp;cluster in the giant molecular cloud complex behind the obscuring veils of dust.</span></p></td>

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">NGC 2264 is at the core of the Mono-ceros <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">OB</span><span class="font19">1 Association (Mon R1), where a well-defined clustering of reflection nebulae lies at the same distance as the association. The region also includes the majestic,&nbsp;though dark, Cone Nebula, a dense 7-light-year-long stalagmite of obscuring matter.&nbsp;Had the ancients known of such a wonder, wrote Robert Burnham, Jr., of the Cone,&nbsp;they would not have called it by “any lesser&nbsp;name than ‘The Throne of God.' Here, as&nbsp;in the Great Orion Nebula, even the modern observer is touched by a strange sensation of having been present at the drama of&nbsp;creation.” No words, however, capture the&nbsp;spectacle of this dark cloud better than the&nbsp;image taken by the Hubble Space Telescope.&nbsp;Although it shows only the tip (2.5 light-years) of the Cone – a height that equals&nbsp;23 million round trips to the Moon – the&nbsp;scene fires the imagination. Some have seen&nbsp;thedarkcloudassomenightmarishcreature&nbsp;thrusting its head through a sea of blood. To&nbsp;others the scene has religious overtones –&nbsp;the silhouette of Christ holding a child. But&nbsp;these dark shadows are actually pillars of&nbsp;dust and gas seen silhouetted against the&nbsp;raucous red sheen of emission nebulae –&nbsp;hydrogen gas set aglow by ultraviolet radiation gushing from the region's young hot&nbsp;stars. The same radiation is slowly eating&nbsp;away at the clouds, shredding the once&nbsp;dense interstellar material into ethereal tendrils of gas.</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Although NGC 2264 is neglected, observers are not totally unaware of it. In fact, for those “in the know,” this cluster is a popular&nbsp;winter target, especially in late December,&nbsp;because its shape resembles that of a welltrimmed Christmas tree. Indeed, Leland&nbsp;Copeland called NGC 2264 the Christmas&nbsp;Tree Cluster. To find it, first locate 2nd-magnitude Gamma (<span class="font5">^ </span><span class="font19">) Geminorum and&nbsp;3rd-magnitude Xi (</span><span class="font5">^</span><span class="font19">) Gem in the feet of The&nbsp;Twins.

William&nbsp;Henry Smyth saw the star&nbsp;as “greenish.” (Bear in mind,&nbsp;though, that this man's vision&nbsp;would often ignite behind&nbsp;the eyepiece, allowing him&nbsp;to see the most vivid colors&nbsp;in the most mundane stars.)&nbsp;The cluster is a remarkable&nbsp;assemblage of some 50 diamonds set against a backdrop&nbsp;of unresolved Milky Way and&nbsp;patches of bright nebulosity. I could also detect a thin</p>

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">In 7 <span class="font5">× </span><span class="font19">50 binoculars from Hawaii, about a dozen stars are visible. In fact, the Christmas Tree Cluster and Rosette Cluster fit in&nbsp;the same field of view. The Christmas Tree&nbsp;Cluster, in fact, looks like the Rosette Cluster (without the nebulosity), only slightly&nbsp;warped, or dented. In my antique telescope,&nbsp;the Christmas Tree Cluster is bordered on&nbsp;either side by a loop of stars resembling butterfly wings.</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">The tree's base, 15 Mon, is a famous semi-regular variable star that also goes by&nbsp;the name S Monocerotis. In his book <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">StarHopping for Backyard Astronomers</span><span class="font19">, Alan M.&nbsp;MacRobert says this luminous young star,&nbsp;whose spectral type is </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">O</span><span class="font19">7, is “about as blue&nbsp;a star as you'll ever see; they don't get bluer&nbsp;stream of nebulosity flowing a few arcminutes southwest from S Mon toward a small&nbsp;grouping of three 8th- to 9th-magnitude&nbsp;suns. This glow is most apparent around&nbsp;S Mon.</span></p></td>

A pale reminder of the&nbsp;photographic splendor, a symphony of light&nbsp;and rippling texture, like the finest red silk&nbsp;blowing in an unsteady wind. I did, however,&nbsp;trace other sections of even fainter nebulosity throughout the entire region, especially around the 7th-magnitude star at the&nbsp;tip of the Christmas Tree asterism. Here is&nbsp;where the dark Cone Nebula resides, which,&nbsp;I suppose, is conspicuous by its absence.&nbsp;Certainly no dark drama unfolds before my&nbsp;eyes in the 4-inch. New York observer Sue&nbsp;French, however, notes that the dark finger of the Cone Nebula can just be detected&nbsp;in her 10-inch Newtonian reflector at 44 .</p></td></tr></table><hr>

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">A 16th-magnitude T-Tauri star near the Cone Nebula began experiencing “impossibly” long eclipses. The star, called KH&nbsp;15D, disappears for more than 26 days out&nbsp;of every 48.36 days. It is near the 7th-magnitude star at the tip of the Christmas&nbsp;Tree asterism. The star is supposed to be&nbsp;magnitude 16 at maximum light, which is&nbsp;a cinch for CCD imagers. If you can see&nbsp;this star visually, you'll have witnessed a star&nbsp;possibly eclipsed by a planetary ripple.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">By the way, did you happen to notice that William Herschel discovered the nebula on&nbsp;the nightafterChristmas? That the cluster is&nbsp;so nicely placed during that holiday season&nbsp;is a tacit reminder, of sorts, of how holy our&nbsp;nights can be when we look beyond the confines of the Earth and into the splendor of&nbsp;the universe.</p></td></tr></table><hr><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"><img src="Hidden Treasures_files/Hidden Treasures-174.jpg" style="width:389pt;height:512pt;"/></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;">

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;">Monoceros, the mythical unicorn, is a relatively large but faint constellation that fills the void between Orion, his two dogs, and Hydra. It is also relatively&nbsp;new, though no one is certain as to when&nbsp;the constellation first appeared in astronomical texts. The German astronomer&nbsp;Jakob Bartsch charted it as “Unicornu” in&nbsp;a catalog that dates to around 1624, but a&nbsp;1564 work alludes to it as “the other Horse&nbsp;south of the Twins and the Crab.” Early&nbsp;Chinese skywatchers knew the four stars&nbsp;that make up the “body” of the Unicorn&nbsp;as the Four Great Canals. And the French&nbsp;scholar Joseph Scalinger found the Unicorn&nbsp;on an old Persian sphere. Johannes Hevelius&nbsp;was the first to detail the constellation's&nbsp;stars in his 1690 <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Prodromus Astronomiae.</span></p></td>

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">And while Monoceros contains no stars brighter than 4th magnitude, the plane of&nbsp;our galaxy slices through the constellation&nbsp;from the northwest, so it is rich in open star&nbsp;clusters–includingNGC2244(RosetteClus-ter), NGC 2264 (Christmas Tree Cluster),&nbsp;and, of course, M50.

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;">8th magnitude and fainter. The cluster lies almost exactly&nbsp;on the galaxy's mid plane,&nbsp;and, as a consequence, is projected against a rich stellar&nbsp;background. Indeed in a photometric study of 900 stars&nbsp;in the cluster to magnitude&nbsp;17, only about 80 members&nbsp;were found. So the visual&nbsp;appearance of the cluster is&nbsp;severely contaminated with&nbsp;field stars. If we accept the&nbsp;cluster's distance of 2,500&nbsp;light-years, NGC 2301 spans&nbsp;11 light-years of space.</p>

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;">In november 2002, i sailed the border of Canis Majoris and Monoceros&nbsp;with my 4-inch refractor, trying to find&nbsp;NGC 2349, one of Caroline Herschel's lost&nbsp;treasures. Although I had no success with&nbsp;NGC 2349, I did discover a wonderland of&nbsp;riches – a field strewn with clusters and dim&nbsp;nebulosity that's scattered across more than&nbsp;3<span class="font2"><sup>◦</sup> </span><span class="font19">of sky. Chief among these new treasures&nbsp;was open cluster NGC 2353, a stunning&nbsp;island of stars, rich stellar sapphires and&nbsp;rubies. So many riches occupied this region&nbsp;that I decided to call it the Pirate's Paradise.&nbsp;I could have made any one of the objects a&nbsp;hidden treasure, but I limited the catch to&nbsp;the brightest and most alluring of them all –&nbsp;NGC 2353, my Avery's Island.</span></p></td>

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Captain Avery was a seventeenth-century pirate whose capture in 1695 of the <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Ganj-i-Swai</span><span class="font19"> – the largest ship belonging to the&nbsp;Great Mogul (emperor of the Mogul Empire&nbsp;in India) – made him a legend. Avery, also&nbsp;known as the Mock King of Madagascar,&nbsp;looted huge quantities of gold and silver&nbsp;from that ship, then wisely retired from his&nbsp;brief career as a pirate. It was rumored that&nbsp;Avery lived out his life on a tropical island&nbsp;(Avery'sIsland)inthepossessionofmillions.&nbsp;“[B]ut it seems that he was swindled of most&nbsp;of his riches by merchants in the West Country,” writes David Cordingly in </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Under the&nbsp;Black Flag</span><span class="font19">, “and that he ended his days in&nbsp;poverty in the village of Bideford in Devon,&nbsp;‘not being worth as much as would buy him&nbsp;a coffin'.” No matter, in deference to the legend, I decided to name an island of stellar&nbsp;riches after Avery and place it in a region&nbsp;that can only be seen in the imagination as&nbsp;a perfect retreat for retired pirates – those&nbsp;who want to live out the rest of their days&nbsp;looking out upon the boundless ocean, surrounded by their booty.</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">This section of sky really is a wonderment. Color images show numerous clusters and&nbsp;stellar groupings tangled in&nbsp;a vast network of reflection,&nbsp;dark, and emission nebulosity in an irregularly round&nbsp;area spanning more than six&nbsp;Moon diameters. The eye can&nbsp;only look upon this beautiful chaos with fuzzy thinking. Here, graceful folds of&nbsp;glowing gas are shaped into&nbsp;long wings by the dark nebulosity surrounding them.&nbsp;The wings are surrounded&nbsp;by van Gogh-like swirls of&nbsp;pastel patches and clumps&nbsp;of starlight. Throughout the&nbsp;region, blue reflection nebulosity shimmers like an&nbsp;afterthought – its hue as light&nbsp;as a warm breeze; a sensual&nbsp;highlight too subtle to ignore.</p></td></tr></table><hr>

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">In 1949, a Georgian-born Armenian astrophysicist Viktor A. Ambartsumian (1908– 1996) proposed that NGC 2353 belongs to&nbsp;the Canis Major <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">OB</span><span class="font19">1 Association – a region&nbsp;inthe plane of the Milky Way where dust and&nbsp;gas are being compressed into new and massive stars. NGC 2353 had, in fact, once been&nbsp;called the nucleus of the CMa </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">OB</span><span class="font19">1 Association. Controversy ensued. Today we know&nbsp;that NGC 2353 is a moderately rich open&nbsp;cluster located </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">near the edge</span><span class="font19"> of the CMa </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">OB</span><span class="font19">1&nbsp;Association. We also know that while NGC&nbsp;2353 is virtually at the same distance and&nbsp;direction as the CMa </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">OB</span><span class="font19">1 Association, the&nbsp;two systems are unrelated.</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Age tells all. Fernando Comero´ n (European Southern Observatory) and his colleagues recently announced that star formation in the CMa <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">OB</span><span class="font19">1 Association was triggered by a single supernova that detonated about l million years ago. This event</span></p></td>
<td valign="top" width="50%"><div style="float:right;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;">occurred at the edge of a dense cloud of gas and dust that measured about 3 light-years&nbsp;wide and had a mass of about 1,000 Suns.&nbsp;Then about 100,000 years ago, the propagating blast wave slammed into another&nbsp;cloud of dust and gas, triggering star formation that continues to this day in a region&nbsp;known as Canis Major R1. With an age of&nbsp;about 76 million years, NGC 2353 severely&nbsp;predates these events, but is still a young&nbsp;cluster. Its age is about midway between&nbsp;that of open cluster NGC 2264 (HT 38) and&nbsp;NGC 2301 (HT 39), both in Monoceros. NGC&nbsp;2353, then, was born at a most interesting time in Earth history – in the late Cretaceous period, when dinosaurs (including Sauropods) were becoming increasingly&nbsp;varied – until their sudden extinction 66 million years ago.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">CMa R1 is a lean star-forming region 100 light-years in extent. It is embedded in a&nbsp;curved region of dark, reflection nebulosity,&nbsp;which is part of a larger ring of emission nebulosity that includes IC 2177 and LBN 1036.&nbsp;The reflection nebulosity, though, may be&nbsp;nearer than the Association. And though it's&nbsp;uncertain, the larger ring of emission nebulosity may be a relatively old supernova&nbsp;remnant. Open cluster NGC 2353 lies on the&nbsp;northeast flank of that ring near LBN 1036.&nbsp;An orange 6th-magnitude star (HD 55879)&nbsp;dominates the cluster field. But again, this&nbsp;too is an illusion; the star is not related to the&nbsp;cluster, whose brightest member shines at&nbsp;9th magnitude. Archinal and Hynes list the&nbsp;cluster as having 106 members, but twice&nbsp;that many may populate the cluster to magnitude 21.0, most of which populate the&nbsp;immediate 5<span class="font2"><sup>^</sup> </span><span class="font19">of the core.</span></p></td></tr></table><hr>

<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Herschel classified this bright group as a coarse scattering of stars. Admiral William&nbsp;Henry Smyth later called it, in his inimitable&nbsp;way, “A neat double star, on the [eastern]&nbsp;boundary of a loose cluster in the Galaxy...&nbsp;both silvery white. This is a very rich field&nbsp;of stars, in the which is a brilliant oval&nbsp;mass, bounded by a sapphire-tinted 6th-magnitude star, in the [southeast] quadrant,&nbsp;and the pair here measured a little north&nbsp;of it.” Smyth also points out that Herschel&nbsp;failed to call attention to these and other&nbsp;doubles in the cluster. But perhaps Herschel&nbsp;did note these stars – and many other pairs.&nbsp;More than one-third ofthe cluster's stars are&nbsp;binary. Hartung noted this as well, saying it&nbsp;is a “fine open group of stars with a definite&nbsp;concentric or roughly spiral pattern...It&nbsp;contains many pairs and small star groups.”</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">If you accept that the 6th-magnitude star superimposed on the cluster marks the&nbsp;position of NGC 2353, then the cluster,&nbsp;arguably can be seen with the naked eye.

Fifth-magnitude Mu&nbsp;(</span><span class="font5">^</span><span class="font19">) CMa lies midway between and a little&nbsp;southwest of those two stars. Using your&nbsp;binoculars, draw an imaginary line from Sirius though Mu, then extend that line about&nbsp;6</span><span class="font2"><sup>◦</sup> </span><span class="font19">to the northeast; you should encounter&nbsp;three 6th-magnitude stars in an arc only </span><span class="font17"><sub>4</sub><sup>3 </sup></span><span class="font2"><sup>◦&nbsp;</sup></span><span class="font19">long and oriented north-northwest–southsoutheast.

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">In the 4-inch at 23<span class="font5">×</span><span class="font19">, the cluster is just as Herschel described it – coarse and scattered.&nbsp;The 6th-magnitude star superimposed on&nbsp;the cluster has an orangish cast and looks&nbsp;much the stranger. It lies on the southern&nbsp;outskirts of the cluster, whose dozen suns or&nbsp;so (at this power), seem to flow radially away&nbsp;from that orange sun. Twolongarms extend&nbsp;to the northwest and southeast of a weak&nbsp;core of suns huddled around the orange 6th-magnitude star and three weak arms fan&nbsp;out to the northwest. With imagination, the&nbsp;cluster at low power looks like a Sauropod,&nbsp;like a Brontosaurus (an Apatosaurus, if you&nbsp;are a purist), galloping, with head down and&nbsp;neck and tail outstretched, on tiptoes.</span></p></td></tr></table><hr>

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">All these clusters are aligned with the long curving nebula IC 2177, most commonly known as the Seagull Nebula, for its&nbsp;appearance in photographs. There is some&nbsp;confusion over the name of the irregularly&nbsp;round nebula forming the Seagull's Head. In&nbsp;Tirion's <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Sky Atlas 2000.0</span><span class="font19">, it is called Gum1. In&nbsp;the </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Millennium Star Atlas</span><span class="font19">,itispartofGum&nbsp;1, which equals IC 2177, which is the entire&nbsp;western side of the nebula complex (save&nbsp;for its southern tip, which is the emission&nbsp;nebula Cederblad 90). In the </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Uranometria&nbsp;2000.0</span><span class="font19">, it is listed as van den Bergh 93. Other&nbsp;references confuse it with NGC 2327. So the&nbsp;Pirate's Paradise is not without its mysteries.</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">The chart shows the region labeled correctly. Let's start with IC 2177, since its history is itself a bit mysterious. In the 1908 <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Second Index Catalogue</span><span class="font19"> Dreyer notes that&nbsp;IC 2177 was discovered by Isaac Roberts, and&nbsp;he references the </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Astronomiche Nachriten&nbsp;</span><span class="font19">(3905). In that work, Roberts announces&nbsp;the discovery of a bright nebula surrounding the 7th-magnitude star BD</span><span class="font5">-</span><span class="font19">10 1848&nbsp;(HD 53367). This nebula – which is, in fact,&nbsp;the brightest in the region – is the irregularly round patch that marks the Seagull's Head. The IC description confirms that&nbsp;fact: “Pretty bright, extremely large, irregularly round, very diffuse.” Roberts makes no&nbsp;mention of the nearly 3</span><span class="font2"><sup>◦</sup> </span><span class="font19">-long arc of nebulosity immediately to the south and east (the&nbsp;Seagull's Wings), so his exposures obviously&nbsp;did not pick it up. Considering these facts,&nbsp;IC 2177 should refer, then, only to the Seagull's Head.</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">If life were only that simple. When I precessed and plotted Dreyer's 1860 position for IC 2177, I discovered that it did not fall on&nbsp;HD 53367 but rather in a dark spit 15<span class="font2"><sup>^</sup> </span><span class="font19">to the&nbsp;southeast (right ascension 07</span><span class="font17"><sup>h</sup> </span><span class="font19">05</span><span class="font17"><sup>m</sup></span><span class="font19">; declination </span><span class="font5">-</span><span class="font19">10</span><span class="font2"><sup>◦</sup> </span><span class="font19">(42</span><span class="font2"><sup>^</sup></span><span class="font19">) – between Robert's Nebula&nbsp;and the westernflank of the Seagull's Wings.&nbsp;That position is the key to understanding&nbsp;the IC 2177 mystery. In a later </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Astronomiche&nbsp;Nachritan</span><span class="font19"> (4082), under the title “Extended&nbsp;nebulosities,” Max Wolf, provides a compelling description of the 2.5-long nebula&nbsp;he imaged in the area southeast of Robert's&nbsp;Nebula – the Seagull's Wings. Clearly, while&nbsp;Dreyer uses only Robert's data as the principal source for the nebula's discovery (probably for the economy of space too), he&nbsp;acknowledged Wolf's contribution by splitting the difference in the two object's positions. If we accept that opinion – which by&nbsp;the way, is independently shared by Hal Corwin – IC 2177 represents both Robert's and&nbsp;Wolf's Nebulae. In other words, both the&nbsp;Seagull's Head and Wings are IC 2177. For&nbsp;this work, I have settled the matter by labeling the Head as “IC 2177 (Robert's Nebula)”&nbsp;and the Wings as “IC 2177 (Wolf's Nebula).”</span></p></td></tr></table><hr>

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Van den Bergh 93 (vdB 93) is yet another correct label for the Seagull's Head – in part.&nbsp;In a 1966 <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Astrophysical Journal</span><span class="font19"> article entitled “A study of reflection nebulae,” Sidney van den Bergh (David Dunlop Observatory) published a catalog of BD and CD&nbsp;stars north of declination </span><span class="font5">-</span><span class="font19">33</span><span class="font2"><sup>◦</sup> </span><span class="font19">, which are&nbsp;surrounded by reflection nebulosity.

<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Any source that lists NGC 2327 as the Seagull's Head is wrong. William Herschel&nbsp;discovered this nebula, observed January&nbsp;31, 1785, and for some reason it has disappeared on many star atlases. Dreyer, in&nbsp;the 1888 <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">NGC</span><span class="font19"> describes it as “Pretty bright&nbsp;double star involved in small, very faint,&nbsp;nebula.”</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">I recommend anyone under a dark sky to try to detect these various nebulae. They are&nbsp;all truly neglected, obviously because of the&nbsp;distorted histories of the celestial players.&nbsp;When Ifirst chanced upon this field without&nbsp;knowing its history I immediately spied the&nbsp;IC 2177 nebulosity. I called it “obvious and&nbsp;easy at 23<span class="font5">×</span><span class="font19">.” Once I confirmed its existence&nbsp;on a star chart, I saw it clearly with 7 </span><span class="font5">× </span><span class="font19">50&nbsp;binoculars and averted vision.</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Through a 10-inch f/5.6 Newtonian and powers varying from 59<span class="font5">× </span><span class="font19">to 141</span><span class="font5">×</span><span class="font19">,&nbsp;David Knisely (Prairie Astronomy Club) saw&nbsp;IC 2177 as a “long faint irregular diffuse band&nbsp;of haze.” The nebula, he notes, is easier to&nbsp;see with an ultra-high-contrast (UHC) filter&nbsp;or an H-Beta filter, both of which boost the&nbsp;contrast of the nebula's core filaments. Similarly, using a 13-inch telescope at 62</span><span class="font5">× </span><span class="font19">and&nbsp;a UHC filter, Steve Gottlieb viewed the nebula as a “very large, very elongated strip of&nbsp;nebulosity.” He found the southern portion&nbsp;difficult to trace, except for the “easily visible” nebula Cederblad 90, which surrounds&nbsp;a magnitude 8.5 star. Cederblad 90 is also&nbsp;known as vdB 94 – a “very bright” reflection nebula that appears 11.2</span><span class="font2"><sup>^</sup> </span><span class="font19">in diameter&nbsp;in both red and blue prints of the Palomar&nbsp;Sky Survey.</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">You can spend hours using your scope to explore this vast region, which, aside from&nbsp;the clusters and nebulosity, is rich in topaz,&nbsp;sapphire, and ruby-colored stars. The most&nbsp;exotic of them all, however, is the fiery red&nbsp;carbon star W Canis Majoris. As with many&nbsp;carbon stars W CMa is also a variable star.

<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;">ngc 2440 is one of the most beautiful and bizarre butterfly-shaped&nbsp;planetary nebulae in the sky. When Rudolf&nbsp;Minkowski (1895–1976) first saw its form on&nbsp;an image taken with the 200-inch reflector&nbsp;atop Mount Palomar in 1964, he called it&nbsp;“an example of an object so complicated&nbsp;it defies description.” The image showed&nbsp;a bright, somewhat elongated nebula with&nbsp;two distinct central condensations and&nbsp;fainter outer filaments, all of which was&nbsp;surrounded by a faint halo. NGC 2440's&nbsp;puzzling nature magnified in 1998, when&nbsp;J. Alberto Lopez (Universidad Nacional&nbsp;Autonoma de Mexico) and his colleagues&nbsp;discovered that three pairs of lobes were&nbsp;emerging at different position angles from&nbsp;the nebula's core. Sun Kwok (University of&nbsp;Calgary) notes that NGC 2440 has one of&nbsp;the most prominent multipolar structures&nbsp;of all planetary nebulae. “Many planetary&nbsp;nebulae,” he says, “probably also have&nbsp;multipolar structures if one looks hard&nbsp;enough, but none is as easy to see as NGC&nbsp;2440.”</p></td>
<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Now Hubble Space Telescope wide-field-camera images complicate matters further. They show the nebula's central star sitting in an irregular hollow surrounded by&nbsp;a shredded chalk-white ring. The shredded&nbsp;area marks the point where fast winds and&nbsp;intense ultraviolet radiation from the central star are eating away at the dense central ring, which is expanding away from the&nbsp;central star at 24 kilometers per second. Several bulbous white polyps (the butterfly's&nbsp;wings) swell away from the ring's hollow;&nbsp;the most prominent of these wings defines</p></td></tr></table><hr>

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;">the object's major axis, which lies perpendicular to our line of sight. The images also show “point-symmetric structure,” which,&nbsp;as Kwok explains in his 2001 book <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Cosmic&nbsp;Butterflies</span><span class="font19">, is a “technical term referring to&nbsp;blobs and filaments on one side of the nebula being reproduced exactly upon reflection onto the other side,” like the letter </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">S.&nbsp;</span><span class="font19">These features, for the moment, defy explanation. When all these features are seen&nbsp;together, NGC 2440 looks like a sidewalk&nbsp;artist's rendering of a white rose after a rainstorm.</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;padding:0pt 0pt 6pt 0pt;">It is not certain whether the NGC 2440's lobes were ejected simultaneously or at different times. One likely scenario is that they&nbsp;formed when the central star underwent&nbsp;three episodes of mass loss. During each&nbsp;episode, a pair of lobes aligned along a different position angle owing to precession&nbsp;in the central disk. Each of these ejections&nbsp;might have been separated in time by about&nbsp;10,000 years.</p></td>
<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Since the HST images clearly separate the central star from the surrounding inner ring,&nbsp;astronomers have been able to make the&nbsp;most accurate estimate yet for the star's&nbsp;temperature: about 200,000 <span class="font2"><sup>◦</sup> </span><span class="font19">C – more than&nbsp;30 times hotter than our Sun – making it&nbsp;one of the hottest stars known in our galaxy.&nbsp;Yervant Terzian (Cornell University) calls&nbsp;NGC 2440 aproto-planetary,or avery young&nbsp;planetarynebula,whichmakessense,given&nbsp;the planetary's diminutive size and the presence of infrared dust in its envelope.</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">But Kwok has a different opinion: “I won't call NGC 2440 a proto-planetary nebula,” he&nbsp;says, “because it has ionized gas. Unfortunately the term proto-planetary nebula has&nbsp;been abused to refer to anything unusual. It&nbsp;is probably a planetary nebula with a high&nbsp;central star mass, as implied by its high central star temperature. Since a high mass star&nbsp;evolves very fast, it is therefore dynamically&nbsp;young. However, in terms of evolution, NGC&nbsp;2440 (like NGC 7027 [Hidden Treasure 104])&nbsp;is ‘old' (i.e. evolved) for its mass. This is a&nbsp;technical distinction. Most people call NGC&nbsp;7027 ‘young' and it is fine (I do that too).&nbsp;The presence of dust is common in almost&nbsp;all planetary nebulae, but for younger ones,&nbsp;the dust has not yet had a chance to disperse,&nbsp;so it is more prominent.”</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">NGC 2440 lies 4.4<span class="font2"><sup>◦</sup> </span><span class="font19">almost exactly due south of another planetary nebula –&nbsp;NGC 2438 –in the bright open star cluster M&nbsp;46, also in Puppis.

But I would suggest using a moderate magnification (like&nbsp;72</span><span class="font5">×</span><span class="font19">), because while NGC 2440 is bright, it&nbsp;looks stellar at low powers. If you want to&nbsp;star hop to it, start at M46, where, just </span><span class="font17"><sub>2</sub><sup>1 </sup></span><span class="font2"><sup>◦</sup> </span><span class="font19">to&nbsp;its southwest, you'll find a 5th-magnitude</span></p></td></tr></table><hr><div style="float:left;layout-flow:horizontal;"><img src="Hidden Treasures_files/Hidden Treasures-185.jpg" style="width:256pt;height:304pt;"/></div>

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;">Sometime prior to 1654, when Italian astronomer Giovanni Batista&nbsp;Hodierna published a catalog of some 40&nbsp;deep-sky objects that he found with a 20<span class="font5">×&nbsp;</span><span class="font19">Galilean refractor, the astronomer placed&nbsp;on one of his star charts an object in the&nbsp;position of NGC 2451.

<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">The issue was convincingly resolved in a 1994 <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Astronomy and Astrophysics</span><span class="font19"> paper&nbsp;entitled “NGC 2451: what is it?” In that&nbsp;work, German astronomers Siegfried Roser&nbsp;and Ulrich Bastian determined via propermotion studies that the stars classically&nbsp;known and observed through amateur&nbsp;instruments are not physically related, so&nbsp;they do not form a true cluster. However,&nbsp;in a 4</span><span class="font2"><sup>◦</sup> </span><span class="font19">-square area around NGC 2451, they&nbsp;did find a group of 24 stars having common&nbsp;proper motion.

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Roser and Bastian also suspect a second cluster in the area at almost twice the distance. Imants Platais (Yale University) and&nbsp;his colleagues, who presented new proper&nbsp;motion studies of the stars in the region of&nbsp;NGC 2451, came to the same conclusion.&nbsp;They “definitely found” the Puppis Moving&nbsp;Group, which they refer to as NGC 2451-A,&nbsp;at 600 light-years. The group also detected a&nbsp;second, more distant, grouping (NGC 2451B) at about 1,300 light-years. Both groups are&nbsp;sparsely populated and appear to be similar&nbsp;in age to the Pleiades, being perhaps about&nbsp;100 million years young. (It's important to&nbsp;note that, as Archinal and Hynes mention&nbsp;in <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Star Clusters</span><span class="font19">, calling these groups NGC&nbsp;2451-A and NGC 2451-B is unfortunate,&nbsp;since they are not listed that way in the&nbsp;</span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">NGC.</span><span class="font19">) Hipparcos data show that the Puppis&nbsp;Moving Group definitively does exist, while&nbsp;the more distant cluster </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">may</span><span class="font19"> exist.</span></p></td>

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;padding:0pt 0pt 7pt 0pt;">I have long seen NGC 2451 as a scorpion approaching me nearly head-on, with two&nbsp;outstretched claws and an upright tail ready&nbsp;to sting. It's a fitting description, because&nbsp;this stinging scorpion, which travels the sky&nbsp;with NGC 2477 (Caldwell 71) about 1 <span class="font17"><sub>2</sub><sup>1 </sup></span><span class="font2"><sup>◦</sup> </span><span class="font19">to&nbsp;the southeast rises just as M71 in the celestial Arrow sets. So we can create our own&nbsp;myth. Ages ago Sagittarius shot Sagitta, the&nbsp;Arrow, toward Puppis, killing our tiny arachnid. Feeling sorry for the innocent creature,&nbsp;Zeus placed the cluster in the company of&nbsp;NGC 2477, as far as possible from the Arrow&nbsp;in the night sky. Thus the Arrow will never&nbsp;again slay the stinging scorpion cluster – just&nbsp;as big brother Scorpius will never again sting&nbsp;the mighty Hunter, Orion.</span></p></td>
<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">I have also seen the cluster looking like a kitten playing with a ball of string. The kit-ten'sheadiscomprisedofthegroup'spromi-nent central triangle of stars: the northern&nbsp;and western stars in that triangle mark the&nbsp;kitten's ears, while brilliant c Puppis marks&nbsp;the kitten's nose. Take the time to study the&nbsp;color of c Puppis. Luginbuhl and Skiff say it&nbsp;is “very red.” Hynes and Archinal, as does&nbsp;John Herschel, claim it is “orange,” and I&nbsp;detected a golden yellow hue, like that of&nbsp;wheat being illuminated by the setting Sun.&nbsp;The “ball of string” is an attractive collection of 10 stars (ranging from 8th- to 11th-magnitude) within 20<span class="font2"><sup>^</sup> </span><span class="font19">of c Puppis, and oriented northeast–southwest. The brightest&nbsp;of these stars form a diamond, which is comprised of three obvious groups of stars: three&nbsp;11th-magnitude suns inan arc immediately&nbsp;southwest of c Puppis and concentric with it,&nbsp;followed by a prominent diamond-shaped&nbsp;clustering of four roughly 8th-magnitude&nbsp;stars, and finally a near-equilateral triangle&nbsp;15</span><span class="font2"><sup>^</sup> </span><span class="font19">to the southwest; the southern apex of&nbsp;that triangle is a bright blue 7th-magnitude&nbsp;gem.</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">As is common in the Puppis region, many of the stars are clustered into pairs or groupings, which add to the complexity of the&nbsp;scene, while the region's colorful stars add&nbsp;to the beauty of the scene. NGC 2451 is best&nbsp;seen at low powers, and it will satisfy any&nbsp;binocular user. My wide-field drawing of&nbsp;NGC 2451 illustrates what is most likely an&nbsp;illusion, but one that is titillating nonetheless – namely, the brightest stars in the&nbsp;region are arranged into weak spiral arms&nbsp;centered on the core component of NGC&nbsp;2451. The most prominent arm extends to&nbsp;the west before curving north. Two weaker&nbsp;arms extend to the south before curving&nbsp;north, and a weak linear arm projects to&nbsp;the north. Only the eastern arm is a bit&nbsp;disjointed, arcing to the southeast before&nbsp;sharply curving north.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">While NGC 2451 is best seen from southerly locals, I used to enjoy sweeping it&nbsp;up in binoculars from my apartment in West&nbsp;Roxbury, Massachusetts, which was high&nbsp;on a hill overlooking light-polluted Boston.&nbsp;From that location, NGC 2451 was only 10<span class="font2"><sup>◦&nbsp;</sup></span><span class="font19">above the horizon. And while I did not see it&nbsp;as well as I had from more southerly locals,&nbsp;its beauty was not diminished, at least not in&nbsp;my eyes and certainly not in my heart. With&nbsp;its stars scintillating wildly at that low altitude, the asterism looked, well, as playful as&nbsp;a kitten.</span></p></td></tr></table><hr><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"><img src="Hidden Treasures_files/Hidden Treasures-193.jpg" style="width:320pt;height:332pt;"/></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"><img src="Hidden Treasures_files/Hidden Treasures-194.jpg" style="width:89pt;height:90pt;"/></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"><img src="Hidden Treasures_files/Hidden Treasures-195.jpg" style="width:97pt;height:74pt;"/></div><br clear="all">

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;">ngc 2467 is an historical headache, in that, depending on the&nbsp;source, the object is listed as either an open&nbsp;star cluster, a nebula, or a star cluster with&nbsp;nebulosity. But we need no medication to&nbsp;alleviate the suffering other than the truth.&nbsp;The solution is simple. William Herschel,&nbsp;the object's discoverer, classified it as a&nbsp;nebula. In fact, he classified it as a planetary&nbsp;nebula, because it appeared round. Today&nbsp;we use Herschel's term, “planetary nebula,”&nbsp;to describe a specific type of nebula – a&nbsp;shell of gas blown off a dying star. But&nbsp;that is not what Herschel had in mind&nbsp;back in the eighteenth century; the man&nbsp;had no means at his disposal to fathom&nbsp;the true nature of this gaseous object. His&nbsp;description applies to the object's physical&nbsp;appearance not its astrophysical nature.&nbsp;In other words, the object was round and&nbsp;looked like Uranus, the gas-giant planet he&nbsp;discovered.</p></td>
<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Note that Herschel also makes no specific mention of a star cluster, though he does&nbsp;state that the nebula is “resolvable.” Herschel believed all nebulae would ultimately&nbsp;resolve into stars, given sufficient aperture&nbsp;and magnification. Therefore, his comment&nbsp;should not be taken out of context. Besides,&nbsp;Herschel had three classes reserved for star&nbsp;clusters, and he did not place our target in&nbsp;any of them. That said, if we are to be true&nbsp;to history, NGC 2467 is the emission nebula commonly known today as Sharpless&nbsp;2–311 – end of story! Larry Mitchell, a&nbsp;Herschel historian, also wants us to note&nbsp;Herschel's profound observation of the nebula's red color.</p></td></tr></table><hr>

<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">The “cluster” commonly mislabeled NGC 2647 today was first identified by Per&nbsp;Collinder in 1931; it carries the name&nbsp;Collinder 164 (Cr 164). According to Archi-nal and Hynes, it is 13,000 light-years distant, shines at magnitude 7.1, and has some&nbsp;50 stars. But in an ironic twist, recent studies&nbsp;now argue that the cluster does not exist, at&nbsp;least not as we imagine it.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">In 1989, Argentinean astronomer A. Feinstein (National University of La Plata) and his colleagues announced that new photometry of the stars in the field of NGC&nbsp;2467, which was assumed to be the nucleus&nbsp;of the Puppis I Association, identifies no&nbsp;unique star group. The stars that Herschel&nbsp;“resolved” in the nebula are but a chance&nbsp;alignment of superimposed star groups in&nbsp;the rich Puppis Milky Way. “From our observations of NGC 2467,” the astronomers&nbsp;explain, “it is concluded that it is not an open&nbsp;cluster.”</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">There are two principal star groups here: (1)ayoungandverydistantswarmof<span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">O-</span><span class="font19">type&nbsp;stars </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">beyond</span><span class="font19"> the Puppis </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">OB</span><span class="font19">2 Association,&nbsp;which delineates a spiral feature in the Milky&nbsp;Way about 13,700 light-years distant, and&nbsp;(2) a closer group (with later </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">B-</span><span class="font19">type stars)&nbsp;about 8,150 light-years distant – the same&nbsp;distance as another spiral feature in the&nbsp;Milky Way, the Puppis </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">OB</span><span class="font19">1 Association. The&nbsp;view is further complicated by the superimposition of two 9th-magnitude open star&nbsp;clusters, Haffner 18 and19 – which lie about&nbsp;10</span><span class="font2"><sup>^</sup> </span><span class="font19">and 2</span><span class="font2"><sup>^</sup> </span><span class="font19">north-northeast of the center of&nbsp;the NGC 2467 nebula complex, respectively.&nbsp;These clusters are, in fact, embedded in the&nbsp;NGC 2467 nebula complex, which itself is&nbsp;part of the Puppis </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">OB</span><span class="font19">2 Association.

<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">The whole complex is a young object with an estimated age of about 2 to 3 million&nbsp;years – around the time when many marine&nbsp;creatures, such as bivalve mollusks, suddenly died out all over the planet. Narciso&nbsp;Ben´ıtez (Johns Hopkins University) and his&nbsp;colleagues believe that a supernova explosion 130 light-years distant (perhaps from&nbsp;the Scorpius–Centaurus Association) could&nbsp;have been the culprit. Such a nearby explosion would have showered the Earth with&nbsp;enough cosmic rays to have thinned its&nbsp;ozone layer by 60 percent. An increase of&nbsp;intense ultraviolet radiation from the Sun&nbsp;could have killed off plankton, which, in&nbsp;turn, would have led to widespread death&nbsp;to the bivalves that live off them. When we&nbsp;look at NGC 2467, and its neighboring stars,&nbsp;we are seeing a moment of creation at a time&nbsp;when widespread death was occurring here&nbsp;on Earth. Early man may have been a witness to this event.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">To summarize, emission nebula NGC 2467, open clusters Haffner 18 and 19, and&nbsp;the Puppis <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">OB</span><span class="font19">2 Association, all belong to&nbsp;one and the same spiral feature, which lies at&nbsp;a distance of about 13,700 light-years from&nbsp;the Sun.

The tale is one of the most&nbsp;familiar and enduring legends from Greece.&nbsp;Its roots date to Pindar's fourth Pythian ode,&nbsp;which the medieval Alexandrian poet Apollonius Rhodius (Apollonius the Rhodian)&nbsp;expanded into an epic sometime in the third&nbsp;century bc.

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;">did some dismembering himself. Sometime during his stay from April 19, 1751, to March 8, 1753, the astronomer broke Argo&nbsp;Navis into three principal pieces: Carina&nbsp;(the Keel), Puppis (the Stern), and Vela (the&nbsp;Sail). He also created the now defunct Malus&nbsp;(the Mast), and Pyxis Nautica (the Mariner's&nbsp;Compass), which still exists, but simply as&nbsp;Pyxis.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Lacaille also cataloged, among other things, 42 “nebulae,” which he placed into&nbsp;three classes: “nebulae without stars” (Class&nbsp;I); “nebulous clusters” (Class II); and “stars&nbsp;accompanied by nebulosity” (Class III).&nbsp;NGC 2547 is the second object in Lacaille's&nbsp;Class III and hence is denoted Lac III-2.&nbsp;This means that while Lacaille could see&nbsp;stars within the “nebula,” he could not fully&nbsp;resolve it with his <span class="font17"><sub>2<a name="footnote7"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark115">7</a></sup></sub><sup></sup> </span><span class="font19">-inch 8</span><span class="font5">× </span><span class="font19">telescope.

But&nbsp;that's an illusion. Gamma<span class="font17"><sup>2</sup> </span><span class="font19">Vel is the brightest and perhaps the most massive Wolf-Rayet star known. Wolf-Rayets are extremely&nbsp;luminous and hot stars inan advanced stage&nbsp;of evolution.

Gamma</span><span class="font17"><sup>2</sup> </span><span class="font19">Vel's shedded matter is colliding with the stellar wind from a spectroscopic </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">O</span><span class="font19">-type giant companion, which has&nbsp;an orbital period of 78.5 days.

That's the way&nbsp;we see things today. A few million years ago,&nbsp;the story would have been different. The&nbsp;Wolf-Rayet star would have been the more&nbsp;massive of the two, having a mass of about&nbsp;40 Suns, but as it is more highly evolved,&nbsp;the star has stripped itself to a quarter of&nbsp;its size. Recent studies reveal that the Wolf-Rayet companion is losing mass at a rate of&nbsp;8 million solar masses per year. Since Wolf-Rayet stars are doomed to perish within a&nbsp;few million years, astronomers have taken a&nbsp;keen interest in Gamma</span><span class="font17"><sup>2</sup> </span><span class="font19">Vel, which may be&nbsp;about 4 million years old and about to end&nbsp;its life in a supernova explosion.</span></p>

While there are no&nbsp;contemporary accounts of his life or death,&nbsp;it is said that Peter asked to be laid on the&nbsp;cross head down because he was not worthy to die in the same manner as Christ.

He can match his mind andspirit&nbsp;against the eternals of space, of time, of cosmic energy; and, with an appropriate balance&nbsp;of pride and humility, he can face the cosmic&nbsp;facts, as becomes the high-born animal that he&nbsp;is'.”</p>

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;">ngc 2546 is yet another beautiful open cluster in Puppis, and yet another&nbsp;inspired discovery by Lacaille. He lists it as&nbsp;the 4th object in Class II (“nebulous clusters”), which represents, in this case, the&nbsp;view as seen with the naked eye and with his&nbsp;1 <span class="font17"><sub>2</sub><sup>1</sup> </span><span class="font19">-inch 8</span><span class="font5">× </span><span class="font19">scope. “One sees with the naked&nbsp;eye two neighboring confused groups of&nbsp;stars; but with the telescope they are small&nbsp;distinct stars, in very great number and very&nbsp;close together.” As Lacaille explains, “The&nbsp;second class of nebulae comprises [s]tars&nbsp;which are only nebulous in appearance&nbsp;to the naked eye, but when seen in the&nbsp;telescope, show up as a cluster of distinct&nbsp;[s]tars, although very close to each other.”</span></p></td>
<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">As with many clusters in the region, NGC 2546 is young; at 30 million years, it is&nbsp;the same age as NGC 2264 (Hidden Treasure&nbsp;38), the Christmas Tree Cluster, in Mono-ceros. The group is very coarse and has&nbsp;40 members of 7th magnitude and fainter,&nbsp;which extend across more than two Moon&nbsp;diameters of sky. If we accept NGC 2546's&nbsp;distance as 3,200 light-years, its true physical diameter is nearly 64 <span class="font17"><sup>1</sup><sub>2</sub> </span><span class="font19">light-years across,&nbsp;which is more than twice as large in true&nbsp;physical extent as NGC 2264, which is 700&nbsp;light-years closer.</span></p>

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:9pt;padding:0pt 0pt 0pt 7pt;">That Lacaille detected NGC 2546 with the naked eye&nbsp;is testament to the observer's&nbsp;prowess.

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;">something very obvious. You must imagine the light of a 5th-magnitude star spread over an area larger than two Moon diameters across. While the cluster can be seen as&nbsp;a nebulous glow with the naked eye from a&nbsp;very dark site with a good southern horizon,&nbsp;it can easily disappear with any sky glow.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">The view is further complicated by the fact that it lies in one of the most glorious sections of the Puppis Milky Way; it is&nbsp;certainly one of my favorites, being so lush&nbsp;with dense patches of starlight. Note, however, that Lacaille saw the cluster with the&nbsp;naked eye as two confused groupings. The&nbsp;other grouping must have been the prominent Lambda (<span class="font5">^</span><span class="font19">)-shaped asterism of suns&nbsp;(</span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font19">) just 2</span><span class="font2"><sup>◦</sup> </span><span class="font19">to the northeast of NGC 2546.&nbsp;Thisveryimpressiveasterismpacksadozen&nbsp;suns, ranging from 5th- to 7th-magnitude,&nbsp;in an area equal to that of NGC 2546. In&nbsp;essence, when you look up at that part of&nbsp;the sky with the naked eye, you see two nebulous patches – one bright (anasterism) and&nbsp;his telescopic sweeps of the heavens, came&nbsp;across the brighter Lambda asterism first,&nbsp;then, while examining it visually with the&nbsp;naked eye, caught sight of NGC 2546 with&nbsp;his averted vision. When he trained his telescope on those neighboring patches of light,&nbsp;he saw them melt into a tangle of clusters&nbsp;comprised of distinct starlight. While we&nbsp;credit Lacaille for the discovery of only NGC&nbsp;2546, we should not discount the fact that&nbsp;he may have also been the original discoverer of vdB-Ha 23 or the equally fascinating&nbsp;Lambda-shaped asterism, or both.</span></p></td>
<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">James Dunlop carried Lacaille's torch of confusion into the nineteenth century. The&nbsp;563rd entry in his 1827 catalog has been&nbsp;identified as NGC 2546. But is it? When&nbsp;Dunlop's coordinates for that entry are precessed to epoch 2000.0, we find ourselves&nbsp;looking about halfway between NGC 2546&nbsp;and vdB-Ha 23. Dunlop's description of the&nbsp;object – “A large cluster of stars of [mixed]&nbsp;magnitude, rather extended figure, not rich&nbsp;in very [faint] stars” – could&nbsp;match either. But the last&nbsp;phrase, “not rich in very&nbsp;[faint] stars,” causes my opinion to lean closer to vdB-Ha 23; while both NGC 2546&nbsp;and vdB-Ha 23 are large and&nbsp;extended, NGC 2546 is rich in&nbsp;faint stars while vdB-Ha 23 is&nbsp;not.</p></td></tr></table><hr>

<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">The Lambda-shaped asterism (and perhaps vdB-Ha 23) appears to be in the&nbsp;Local Interstellar Medium,&nbsp;which flanks part of the&nbsp;Local Bubble – a great cavity&nbsp;some 300 light-years across,&nbsp;within which our Sun and&nbsp;many nearby stars reside.&nbsp;The “Bubble” is actually&nbsp;hourglass-shaped, being narrowest toward the galactic&nbsp;plane and open-ended&nbsp;above and below it. The&nbsp;Puppis–Vela component is&nbsp;sheet-like and extends in galactic longitude from 245<span class="font2"><sup>◦</sup> </span><span class="font19">to 275</span><span class="font2"><sup>◦</sup> </span><span class="font19">, in galactic latitude&nbsp;from </span><span class="font5">-</span><span class="font19">15</span><span class="font2"><sup>◦</sup> </span><span class="font19">to </span><span class="font5">+</span><span class="font19">5</span><span class="font2"><sup>◦</sup> </span><span class="font19">, and in distance out to&nbsp;about 3,260 light-years. Although the stars&nbsp;in the asterism are not physically related as&nbsp;a moving group, some (or all) of its stars&nbsp;may belong to the same Milky Way structure as NGC 2546 but about 700 light-years&nbsp;closer.</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">In 7 <span class="font5">× </span><span class="font19">50 binoculars, the bulk of the cluster covers nearly a degree in size&nbsp;and appears elongated, oriented southsoutheast–north-northwest. It is nestled&nbsp;inside an acute triangle of 6th-magnitude&nbsp;suns. In the antique telescope the stars&nbsp;are quite prominent. The surrounding triangle becomes a trapezoid if you add</span></p></td>

It's as if some invisible force had blown air into the center of this&nbsp;cluster causing it to froth up like foam. The&nbsp;southeasternandnorthwesternflanksofthe&nbsp;cluster contain the brightest stars. Those&nbsp;at the southeastern end form a disorderly,&nbsp;zigzagging line, while those at the northwestern end are arranged in a warped “J.”</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Defocus the cluster ever so slightly and relax your gaze. Do you see the stars inside&nbsp;the trapezoid as a heart? It contains several&nbsp;beautiful pairs of stars; four of which are part&nbsp;of a sinuous vine of 10th- to 12th-magnitude&nbsp;stars, oriented east–northwest, which wrap&nbsp;the heart like a crown of thorns (the Christian symbol for the “Wounded Heart” of&nbsp;Christ). Now, if you include the bright “J” of&nbsp;stars to the northwest, and follow its shaft,&nbsp;you will see another row of suns slicing into&nbsp;the heart from northwest to southeast; it&nbsp;exits the heart at a pair of 9th- and 10th-magnitude stars. Here we have a pirate's tat-too–aheartanddagger.Thecrownofthorns&nbsp;now becomes that playful ribbon reading&nbsp;“Mom.”</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">The cluster loses its luster at high powers. But do look at the western-most 6th-magnitude sun in the acute triangle,&nbsp;because it is a beautiful golden nugget at the&nbsp;end of the dagger's hilt. Also, immediately&nbsp;southeast of that gem is a roughly 7<span class="font2"><sup>^</sup> </span><span class="font19">-long&nbsp;string of suns (the hilt's hand guard) that&nbsp;includes a star-shaped clustering of 11th-magnitude suns on the northeast end and&nbsp;a 10th-magnitude double star at the southwest end. The asterism looks like a tiny&nbsp;skeleton key . . . the key to the heart.</span></p></td></tr></table><hr><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"><img src="Hidden Treasures_files/Hidden Treasures-219.jpg" style="width:389pt;height:512pt;"/></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;">

Little&nbsp;wonder, then, that few observers venture&nbsp;into this inner sanctum of the naked-eye&nbsp;sky, especially since many reference books&nbsp;say the constellation has little to offer,&nbsp;except, say, for a few double stars and the&nbsp;dim and distant globular cluster NGC 2419&nbsp;(Caldwell 25), the Intergalactic Tramp.</p>

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">On early photographic plates, astronomers noticed that the galaxy's tiny nucleus is centered in a peanut-shaped&nbsp;bulge. In fact, only part of the nucleus peeks&nbsp;above the surrounding core.

It belongs&nbsp;to the Leo Spur of Galaxies and is receding&nbsp;from us at a speed of 415 kilometers per second. Other members of this clan include the&nbsp;hidden treasure galaxies NGC 2841, 2903,&nbsp;3184, 3344, 3521, 3621, and 3628. In 1999,&nbsp;E. Pompei (University of Trieste) and his colleagues announced the discoveryofastellar&nbsp;system within NGC 2683 that rotates against&nbsp;the spiral pattern. They also found opposing gas flows in the disk. These data imply&nbsp;that either a companion has merged with&nbsp;thegalaxy,orperhapsafast-movingbarnear&nbsp;the galaxy's minor axis is causing gas to fall&nbsp;into the bar. In the latter case, such infalling&nbsp;gas flow can cause episodes of starburst.&nbsp;NGC 2683 has an unresolved radio core and&nbsp;X-ray emission has also been observed from&nbsp;its central region, so the galaxy could be a&nbsp;candidate for a previously unknown active&nbsp;galactic nucleus.

K.&nbsp;Sil'chenko (Special Astrophysical Observatory) and&nbsp;his colleagues announced&nbsp;in 1990 that NGC 2655 may&nbsp;be a new nearby Seyfert&nbsp;galaxy – one with a hot,&nbsp;fast-moving disk of gas near&nbsp;the galactic center. That disk&nbsp;has a diameter of about 1,600&nbsp;light-years and has a mass&nbsp;of about 10 million Suns.&nbsp;A probable black hole lurks at the heart of&nbsp;that swirling madness. If true, as the material falls into the black hole, frictional heating should cause it to turn into a concentrated plasma, which will be propelled out of&nbsp;the nucleus by intense and twisted magnetic&nbsp;fields at nearly the speed of light. Indeed,&nbsp;NGC 2655 contains strong jetlike features&nbsp;extending 6,000 light-years southeast of the&nbsp;nucleus, and a weaker jet extending about&nbsp;15,000 light-years to the northwest.

A bright starlike Seyfert&nbsp;nucleus punctuates the galaxy's amorphous&nbsp;central lens, which otherwise resembles&nbsp;an elliptical or lenticular galaxy; in other&nbsp;words, the lens is devoid of dust or spiral&nbsp;structure. Optical and near-infrared observations of the nucleus, however, suggest&nbsp;that it is surrounded by a ring of enhanced&nbsp;star formation between 6,500 and 23,000&nbsp;light-years out from the central region. This&nbsp;is also an area of enhanced H II activity&nbsp;which also contributes to the overall bluer&nbsp;color of this region.

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Finding NGC 2841 is more like taking a leisurely stroll to a neighbor's house rather&nbsp;than going on a long treasure hunt; the&nbsp;galaxy lies only about 1 <span class="font17"><sub>4</sub><sup>3 </sup></span><span class="font2"><sup>◦</sup> </span><span class="font19">west-southwest&nbsp;of 3rd-magnitude Theta (</span><span class="font5">^ </span><span class="font19">) Ursae Majoris,&nbsp;in the Great Bear's right foreleg.

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">For a 9th-magnitude galaxy, NGC 2841 is deceivingly bright. I could see its central&nbsp;lens in astronomical twilight through the 4-inch at 23<span class="font5">×</span><span class="font19">. I wasn't surprised. More than&nbsp;a quarter-century before, I had encountered this galaxy while hunting for comets&nbsp;with the 9-inch f/12 Clark refractor at&nbsp;Harvard College Observatory. Despite the&nbsp;light-polluted skies of Cambridge, Massachusetts, I could clearly see the galaxy's&nbsp;bright central lens and quickly became&nbsp;enamored by its cometary nature. Finding&nbsp;the galaxy gave me hope that I would some&nbsp;day discover a 9th-magnitude comet from&nbsp;that city location. And though I did not meet&nbsp;with success in that endeavor, I appreciated&nbsp;discovering new celebrities, like NGC 2841,&nbsp;whose sudden appearance in&nbsp;the eyepiece would stir me&nbsp;spiritually.</span></p></td>

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Now, whenever darkness falls over Hawaii, I can see&nbsp;NGC 2841 with averted vision&nbsp;in 7 <span class="font5">× </span><span class="font19">50 binoculars, looking&nbsp;like the dim companion to&nbsp;a 9th-magnitude star about&nbsp;5</span><span class="font2"><sup>^</sup> </span><span class="font19">to the northeast. In my&nbsp;antique scope the galaxy&nbsp;looks like a dim vapor&nbsp;trail, oriented northwest–&nbsp;southeast, drifting by that&nbsp;9th-magnitude star. In the 4-inch, 23</span><span class="font5">× </span><span class="font19">will show NGC 2841&nbsp;as an elongated glow with a&nbsp;sharp stellar nucleus, which&nbsp;looks like a moonlit stone&nbsp;centered in a pool of vapors.&nbsp;Be aware that a prominent&nbsp;11th-magnitude star can&nbsp;be seen northwest of the nucleus in the disk;&nbsp;that star can cause you to think that a supernova has erupted.</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">The galaxy can be viewed as a false comet in two respects: (1) at low power, the&nbsp;galaxy and its close 9th-magnitude companion resemble the fuzzy double star M40,&nbsp;which John Hevelius mistook as cometary&nbsp;in nature in 1660. And (2) at higher powers, the galaxy disk displays a sharp nucleus&nbsp;surrounded by the soft cometary glow of&nbsp;unresolved starlight. At 72<span class="font5">×</span><span class="font19">, for instance,&nbsp;the galaxy's starlike nucleus lies within a&nbsp;slightly elliptical inner lens, that looks like&nbsp;the comet with a tail seen nearly head&nbsp;on.

The rest of the disk is milky smooth –&nbsp;a view shared by the galaxy's discoverer,</span></p></td></tr></table><hr>

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">The mottled northwest section of the galaxy appears brighter than the southeast&nbsp;side, so your eyes may be drawn to that section first. The reason for these appearances&nbsp;is evident at 101<span class="font5">×</span><span class="font19">. Not one but four stars&nbsp;lie in the galaxy's northwest quadrant: the&nbsp;11th-magnitude sun already mentioned, a&nbsp;13th-magnitudestarabutsthegalaxy'swest-northwest flank; a 13.5-magnitude star hugs&nbsp;the northeast flank; and a 14th-magnitude&nbsp;sun lies in the disk's northeast quadrant.

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">There also appears to be a bar running along the galaxy's major axis, but this is just&nbsp;an illusion. If you look at a line drawing of a&nbsp;circle with radial spokes, the radial lines are&nbsp;all equidistant when viewed face on. But if&nbsp;you view the circle obliquely, almost edge-on, you will see a “bar” of light appear along&nbsp;the axis perpendicular to your line of sight –&nbsp;like the band of light that characterizes&nbsp;Tiger Eye – a gemstone frequently found in&nbsp;pendants and once craved by Pirates, who&nbsp;believed the stone would offer them protection during their journeys and strengthen&nbsp;their convictions and confidence. Ironically,&nbsp;seen in photographs there is a bright linear strip on the galaxy's minor axis, that&nbsp;just happens to be in the same place as a&nbsp;dark dust lane. Spectra of this strip with the&nbsp;Keck II telescope show it to be identical to&nbsp;spectra of the bulge area. This indicates the&nbsp;emission from this optical strip is the product of scattered light from the bulge. It is&nbsp;thought this scattering cloud could extend&nbsp;to over 1,600 light-years above the plane&nbsp;of the galaxy. This is similar to the heights&nbsp;of other dust features found in similar&nbsp;galaxies.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">My drawing of NGC 2841 shows the extremely delicate details that can be spied&nbsp;over time. It is like trying to render the fine&nbsp;filigree adorning a Victorian wedding gown.&nbsp;To see these details, you may want to do&nbsp;what I did, and that is to start early in astronomical twilight and draw thebrightest features first. Fainter details will emerge gradually thereafter. Do you see the inner lens as&nbsp;uniform in brightness? Also look for a dense&nbsp;knot or arc of material immediately southwest of the lens; it appears to be separated&nbsp;from the lens by a wafer-thin lane of dust,&nbsp;which is just at the limit of vision in the 4-inch. Another arc, a bit more diffuse, lies&nbsp;at the galaxy's extreme southeastern edge.&nbsp;Observers using larger telescopes have also&nbsp;noted seeing a dark patch or lane preceding&nbsp;the nucleus. The Third Earl of Rosse was so&nbsp;duly impressed with the view of NGC 2841 in&nbsp;his great Leviathan telescope at Birr Castle in&nbsp;Ireland, that he likened itto the “Andromeda&nbsp;Nebula.”</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">But trying to spot the finer details in NGC 2841, whose disk is fragmented into&nbsp;countless arcs of light and dark, is like trying to spot a tiger in the grass – the tiger's&nbsp;color and stripes mimic the way light and&nbsp;shadow play in the grass so that the tiger&nbsp;seems to be everywhere at once. Indeed, as&nbsp;soon I pick up some faint detail in NGC&nbsp;2841 with averted vision, my eye tries to&nbsp;zero in on it with direct vision. But that&nbsp;only causes that detail to fade from view,&nbsp;until my averted vision picks up another&nbsp;faint detail somewhere else in the disk, and&nbsp;the process starts over again, and again, <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">ad&nbsp;infinitum.</span></p></td></tr></table><hr><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"><img src="Hidden Treasures_files/Hidden Treasures-229.jpg" style="width:22pt;height:17pt;"/></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"><img src="Hidden Treasures_files/Hidden Treasures-230.jpg" style="width:320pt;height:332pt;"/></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"><img src="Hidden Treasures_files/Hidden Treasures-231.jpg" style="width:88pt;height:90pt;"/></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"><img src="Hidden Treasures_files/Hidden Treasures-232.jpg" style="width:97pt;height:74pt;"/></div><br clear="all">

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;">Despite being very bright, IC 2488, is a little-studied open cluster&nbsp;in the deep southern sky. Open clusters, especially those containing stars in&nbsp;advanced stages of evolution, are particularly valuable to astronomers testing&nbsp;models of stellar evolution. Stars in open&nbsp;clusters are all born at about the same time,&nbsp;so they are all about the same age. But just&nbsp;glance at a cluster and you'll see that the&nbsp;stars vary in brightness. If we could bring all&nbsp;these stars to the same distance as the Sun,&nbsp;then plot their brightnesses and temperatures, we'd discover that they would run&nbsp;in a continuous series from bright to faint,&nbsp;from hot to cool, from massive to light, and&nbsp;from larger to smaller. This series, called the&nbsp;<span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">main sequence</span><span class="font19">, represents the hydrogenburning phase of a star's evolution. The&nbsp;main sequence, is, as the late Harvard&nbsp;astronomer Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin&nbsp;called it, the backbone of the famous&nbsp;Hertzsprung–Russell diagram of stellar&nbsp;evolution.</span></p></td>
<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">As the cluster ages, the first stars to leave the main sequence are the massive hot, blue&nbsp;stars, which burn their fuel more rapidly&nbsp;than less massive stars; they are also the&nbsp;first to become red giants – stars that have&nbsp;exhausted their core supply of hydrogen and&nbsp;are now fusing hydrogen to helium in a shell&nbsp;outside their cores, or doing both. Of course,&nbsp;as the cluster ages, more and more stars use&nbsp;up their fuel and become red giants. The&nbsp;Hertzsprung–Russell diagram then is like a&nbsp;snapshot of the evolutionary state of a cluster. It is a reflection of a cluster's age; the&nbsp;older an open star cluster gets, the redder&nbsp;its Hertzsprung–Russell diagram becomes.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Young IC 2488 should be of special interest to astronomers because it contains several red-giant members.

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;padding:0pt 0pt 7pt 0pt;">To find this interesting object, one needs only to know the False Cross, a celestial signpost as familiar to many Southern Hemisphere observers as the Southern Cross&nbsp;itself. The False Cross is an asterism that&nbsp;looks like Crux, is at nearly the same declination asCrux, has the same orientation in the&nbsp;skyas Crux, but is slightly larger than Crux. It&nbsp;is also about the same distance west of the&nbsp;great Eta (<span class="font5">^</span><span class="font19">) Carinae Nebula (Caldwell 92)&nbsp;as the Southern Cross is east of it. The False&nbsp;Cross is comprised of four 2nd-magnitude&nbsp;stars – Delta (</span><span class="font5">^</span><span class="font19">) and Kappa (</span><span class="font5">^</span><span class="font19">) Velorum, and&nbsp;30</span><span class="font2"><sup>^</sup> </span><span class="font19">(about one Moon diameter) due west&nbsp;of that tangerine star.

He describes it as a “faint cluster of&nbsp;[faint] stars of mixed magnitude, with two&nbsp;or three pretty bright stars in it.” Dunlop&nbsp;also notes that the cluster is probably Bode's&nbsp;485 Argus which, he says “is described as a&nbsp;[faint]starsurroundedbynebula.”Butitwas&nbsp;the Abbe´ Nicolas Louis de Lacaille (1713–&nbsp;1762) who first discovered this cluster during his famous expedition to the Cape of&nbsp;Good Hope in southern Africa. From April&nbsp;19, 1751, to March 8, 1753, Lacaille cataloged, among other things, 42 “nebulae,”&nbsp;which first appeared as a list in 1755, in&nbsp;the </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Memoirs</span><span class="font19"> of the French Royal Academy&nbsp;of Science. In that work, entitled </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">On the&nbsp;Nebulous Stars of the Southern Sky</span><span class="font19">, Lacaille&nbsp;describes the nature of these objects:</span></p>
<p class="font18" style="text-align:justify;padding:0pt 0pt 0pt 9pt;">I first observe that three kinds of nebulae can be distinguished in the heavens; the first is no&nbsp;more than a whitish, ill-defined area, more or&nbsp;less luminous and of a very irregular shape:&nbsp;these patches are quite similar to the nuclei of&nbsp;faint, tail-less comets.</p>
<p class="font18" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:8pt;padding:0pt 0pt 0pt 9pt;">The second class of nebulae comprises Stars which are only nebulous in appearance and to&nbsp;the naked eye, but when seen in the telescope,&nbsp;show up as a cluster of distinct Stars, although&nbsp;very close to each other.</p>
<p class="font18" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:8pt;padding:0pt 0pt 7pt 9pt;">The third class of nebulae comprises Stars which are actually accompanied by or surrounded with white patches or by nebulae of&nbsp;the first class.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;padding:0pt 0pt 95pt 0pt;">Lacaille listed our target as the 4th object in his third class. Through a <span class="font17"><sup>1</sup><sub>2</sub> </span><span class="font19">-inch telescope&nbsp;at 8</span><span class="font5">×</span><span class="font19">, he described it simply as a “faint star&nbsp;surrounded by nebulosity.” Dreyer included&nbsp;the object in his 1908 </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Second Index Catalogue</span><span class="font19"> as IC 2488, where it is simply described</span></p><img src="Hidden Treasures_files/Hidden Treasures-235.jpg" style="width:170pt;height:111pt;"/></td>

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;">as a “coarse” cluster. Interestingly, Dreyer did not credit Lacaille with the discovery. He instead refers the reader to Harvard astronomer Solon Bailey's <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Catalogue of&nbsp;Bright Clusters and Nebulae</span><span class="font19">, which contains&nbsp;13 clusters not in the </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">NGC.</span><span class="font19"> Dreyer was not&nbsp;trying to slight Lacaille; he was prudently&nbsp;acknowledging the source of his position&nbsp;for the cluster, which Bailey obtained from&nbsp;photographic plates taken with the 24-inch&nbsp;Bruce telescope at Arequipa, Peru.</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:right;">Lacaille's simple description of IC 2488 is apt for his aperture. In 7<span class="font5">× </span><span class="font19">50 binoculars from Hawaii, the cluster clings to N Vel&nbsp;like a piece of ill-defined lint. The antique&nbsp;telescope makes it look grainy. With time,&nbsp;its brightest members pop into view like&nbsp;popcorn. At 23</span><span class="font5">× </span><span class="font19">in the 4-inch, IC 2488 is&nbsp;a weak assemblage of some 30 suns (10th-magnitude and fainter) spread out in a&nbsp;northwest–southeast direction across about&nbsp;15</span><span class="font2"><sup>^</sup> </span><span class="font19">of sky. It's also divided into two disparate groups of mismatched suns. A bright&nbsp;5</span><span class="font2"><sup>^</sup> </span><span class="font19">“core” of about a dozen 10th- to 11th-magnitude suns lies a bit&nbsp;closer to N Vel than does a&nbsp;wider wash of stars spreading out to the northwest. At&nbsp;this power, this core appears&nbsp;to have several arms radiating out from the core, especially to the east-northeast,&nbsp;southeast, south, and southwest. At 72</span><span class="font5">×</span><span class="font19">, the coarse cluster spreads out and loses&nbsp;its appeal. Still, the “core”&nbsp;is most alluring, because it&nbsp;is comprised of two striking&nbsp;parallel rows of stars, many of&nbsp;which are in pairs. The rows&nbsp;are oriented north–south and&nbsp;look like two strings of pearls&nbsp;being lifted from a chest of scattered pearls.&nbsp;Those with larger apertures observing from&nbsp;more southerly locations will probably get a&nbsp;much richer view, since the cluster contains&nbsp;some 70 members out to 18</span><span class="font2"><sup>^</sup> </span><span class="font19">, which at a distance of 4,700 light-years, equates to a true&nbsp;physical extent of 25 light-years.</span></p></td></tr></table><hr>

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Celestial pirates with large apertures may want to dig deep into this little treasure&nbsp;chest, because hidden among the scattered&nbsp;jewels of IC 2488 is the planetary nebula&nbsp;RCW 44, also known as VBRC 2 and ESO 166-PN21. First discovered by James D.

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;">Iwasborn172 years to the day that Sir William Herschel discovered NGC&nbsp;2903, a dramatic spiral galaxy in the Sickle&nbsp;of Leo. Actually, Herschel believed he&nbsp;discovered two objects here. As William&nbsp;Henry Smyth tells us in his <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Cycle of Celestial&nbsp;Objects</span><span class="font19">, Herschel saw itas a “double nebula,&nbsp;each having a seeming nucleus, with their&nbsp;apparent nebulosities running into each&nbsp;other.” Smyth's own observations revealed&nbsp;that the object's “upper or south part, is&nbsp;better defined than the lower; it requires,&nbsp;however, the closest attention and most&nbsp;patient watching, to make it a bicentral&nbsp;object.” The Rev. Thomas W. Webb carried&nbsp;this visual impression into the nineteenth&nbsp;century: “Long, with two nuclei, rather&nbsp;faint.” It took the Third Earl of Rosse's great&nbsp;72-inch Leviathan at Birr Castle, however,&nbsp;to resolve it into an oblique spiral. Even&nbsp;then, no one knew of this object's grand&nbsp;nature until after 1923. In October of that&nbsp;year, Edwin Hubble used the 100-inch&nbsp;Hooker reflector atop Mount Wilson in&nbsp;California to study individual Cepheid&nbsp;variable stars in what was then known as&nbsp;the Great Andromeda Nebula. The results of&nbsp;his study established for the first time that&nbsp;“spiral nebulae” were actually extragalactic&nbsp;systems lying far beyond the confines of the&nbsp;Milky Way.</span></p></td>

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">NGC 2903 lies 20 million light-years distant in the Leo Spur of Galaxies. It is a moderately large system measuring 60,000&nbsp;light-years in diameter. It has a total mass&nbsp;of 80 billion Suns. A very bright nucleus&nbsp;punctuates the galaxy's short, bright bar,&nbsp;from which a complex pattern of partially&nbsp;resolved arms unwind. The inner lens contains two, thick spiral arms that have an&nbsp;exceptionally high surface brightness. Two&nbsp;thin, regular spiral arms are also present in&nbsp;the outer regions. In general all arms show&nbsp;color differences from that of the disk. The&nbsp;northwest arm divides into two branches&nbsp;and interestingly one branch seems to&nbsp;have only old population stars while the&nbsp;other shows evidence of young stars and&nbsp;gas.</p></td></tr></table><hr>

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Yet, the details in NGC 2903 are quiet impressive. Dust appears as spiral fragments and the dust lane along the bar on&nbsp;either side of the nucleus is located on the&nbsp;leading edge of the bar relative to the direction of rotation. This is a common characteristic of dusty barred spiral galaxies. They&nbsp;are thought to be shocks in the vicinity of&nbsp;the bar that are caused by the bar's rota-tion.Thenucleusiscomposedofabouteight&nbsp;giant H-II regions, which lie within 2,000&nbsp;light-years of the core.

When the Hubble&nbsp;Space Telescope inspected this region with a&nbsp;high-resolution near-infrared camera, it too&nbsp;found a series of hot spots forming a ring&nbsp;within 2,000 light-years of the core. These&nbsp;appear to be individual clusters or groups&nbsp;of bright young stars not coincident with the&nbsp;H-II regions. The star-formation rate in this&nbsp;“hot-spot” galaxy (named so for the intense&nbsp;star formation that is occurring within the&nbsp;complex hot-spot structures in the nuclear&nbsp;regions) has increased during the lifetime&nbsp;of the galaxy – only slightly in the arms but&nbsp;spectacularly in the nuclear region.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">A color view of that HST image shows the hot young clusters as a fringe of blue&nbsp;filigree that appear to be stitched to the&nbsp;galaxy's old ochre-colored core.

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">When William Herschel discovered NGC 3184 on March 18, 1787, he described it as&nbsp;being“bright,round,verygraduallybrighter&nbsp;in the middle, 8<span class="font2"><sup>^</sup> </span><span class="font19">diameter, considerable&nbsp;stars in it, unconnected.” William's son,&nbsp;John, also observed it, buthe classified it asa&nbsp;double object (688 </span><span class="font5">= </span><span class="font19">689), and so NGC 3184&nbsp;is also equal to NGC 3180. Neither of these&nbsp;observers wrote anything about observing&nbsp;NGC 3180, however. But Lord Rosse noted&nbsp;that NGC 3180 is within 5</span><span class="font2"><sup>^^</sup> </span><span class="font19">of NGC 3184,&nbsp;adding that it is “connected with h 688.”&nbsp;Lord Rosse also described NGC 3180 as&nbsp;being very faint and elongated. Hal Corwin explains that NGC 3180 is a star cloud&nbsp;or H-II region in NGC 3184's northwestern arm. Dreyer's position of NGC 3180, he&nbsp;says, “fits the star cloud better, but the H-II&nbsp;region is brighter, though smaller. The number may well apply to both objects or simply&nbsp;the general area of the arm where they are&nbsp;found.” But there's more. NGC 3181 is also in&nbsp;NGC 3184. Corwin says it is the brightest H-II region in NGC 3184, located southwest of&nbsp;the nucleus.</span></p></td>

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">While NGC 3184 can indeed be spied in small apertures, it is only by staring at this&nbsp;galaxy with fits and starts that I can discern any detail. I struggle with this object&nbsp;at high power: I truly struggle. Yet, this&nbsp;galaxy is an overwhelming favorite among&nbsp;observers (see Appendix D). Obviously it&nbsp;is an object best suited for detailed study&nbsp;by those owning larger telescopes than a&nbsp;4-inch. Actually, most of the reports I've&nbsp;read of views through larger instruments do&nbsp;not add much to the scene. Houston, for&nbsp;instance, says that through an 8-inch, the&nbsp;galaxy looks like a “pale disk about 5<span class="font2"><sup>^</sup> </span><span class="font19">across&nbsp;with a bright center. At 30</span><span class="font5">× </span><span class="font19">it looks much&nbsp;the way the well-known spiral M33 does in&nbsp;my 2-inch finderscope,” which is whyI call it&nbsp;the Little Pinwheel. Luginbuhl and Skiff say&nbsp;that the galaxy appears horseshoe-shaped&nbsp;at 200</span><span class="font5">× </span><span class="font19">in a 10-inch telescope. Most surprising is that they do not see a distinct&nbsp;core or nucleus in a 12-inch telescope: “the&nbsp;galaxy showing almost no general brightening to the center.” Tokuo Nakamoto of Temple City, California, glimpsed a hint of spiral&nbsp;structure with a 13-inch.</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">The true beauty of NGC 3184 remains in the photographic image. In shape and size it&nbsp;is a near dead-ringer of the Great Pinwheel&nbsp;galaxy M101, in the same constellation. Both&nbsp;galaxies measure about 60,000 light-years in&nbsp;true physical extent. But, if we accept that&nbsp;NGC 3184 is 36 million light-years distant, it&nbsp;is twice the distance of M101, so it appears&nbsp;fainter inthe sky.

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;">ngc 3228 is a tiny gem of an open cluster adorning the inner relatively dustfree edge of the Carina–Cygnus arm of the&nbsp;Milky Way. At a distance of 1,600 light-years,&nbsp;the cluster's paltry 23 or so members span&nbsp;an almost insignificant 2 light-years of&nbsp;space. Yet the cluster is simply adorable&nbsp;in small apertures. Abbe Nicolas Louis de&nbsp;Lacaille discovered it during his investigation of the southern skies from the Cape of&nbsp;Good Hope in southern Africa and included&nbsp;it in his 1755 catalog of new “nebulae.”&nbsp;It was the seventh “nebulous cluster” he&nbsp;discovered with his <span class="font17"><sub>2</sub><sup>1</sup> </span><span class="font19">-inch 8</span><span class="font5">× </span><span class="font19">telescope,&nbsp;calling it a “group of four or five stars, very&nbsp;[faint] and very compressed.”</span></p></td>

When the&nbsp;nineteenth-century southern sky explorer&nbsp;James Dunlop observed this object from&nbsp;Paramatta, New South Wales, with a 9-inch&nbsp;f/12 reflector, he added another layer to&nbsp;the verbal description, calling it a “group of&nbsp;eight or ten pretty bright [faint] stars, with&nbsp;very [faint] stars, about 6</span><span class="font2"><sup>^</sup> </span><span class="font19">diameter.” Today,&nbsp;photographs of the region show a beautiful&nbsp;assortment of two dozen bright jewels lying&nbsp;on a carpet bristling with dim diamond dust;&nbsp;the dimmer stars, of course, belong to the&nbsp;intense backdrop of the rich Vela Milky Way.</span></p>

It shines like a diamond ring at the end of the eastern arm of the&nbsp;famousSouthernCross,anditsbeautyhelps&nbsp;to illuminate the bleak shores of that Black&nbsp;Sea of nebulosity known as Coalsack Nebula to its south.

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;">wide-field telescope under dark skies will show. Some of the cluster's stars illuminate&nbsp;a river of reflection nebulosity in the northern part of NGC 3293, while immediately&nbsp;to the cluster's southeast lies a dark nebula,&nbsp;which appears to be part of the prominent&nbsp;dust lane that runs through the Eta Carinae&nbsp;Nebula. D. G. Turner (David Dunlop Observatory) and his colleagues have raised the&nbsp;possibility that NGC 3293 may be associated with other objects in the Carina Nebula complex, which is the heart of the Carina&nbsp;<span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">OB</span><span class="font19">1 association.</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">NGC 3293 is very young (<span class="font5">∼</span><span class="font19">10 million years) and contains a large number of </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">B</span><span class="font19">-type giants and supergiants, as well as an</span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">M</span><span class="font19">-type supergiant. Its age is similar to that of&nbsp;the Double Cluster in Perseus (Caldwell 14).&nbsp;Turner and his colleagues suspect that NGC&nbsp;3293 may be physically related to IC 2581,&nbsp;another 4th-magnitude cluster in Carina,&nbsp;about 1 </span><span class="font17"><sub>4</sub><sup>1 </sup></span><span class="font2"><sup>◦</sup> </span><span class="font19">to the northwest. Turner and his&nbsp;colleagues see them as a Southern Hemisphere analog to the Double Cluster, though&nbsp;more data need to be collected to confirm&nbsp;this theory (see also Hidden Treasures 25&nbsp;and 26).</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Based on their studies of the region, Turner and his colleagues suggest that the&nbsp;star-forming process in the Carina <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">OB</span><span class="font19">1&nbsp;Association, which was initiated in the&nbsp;northwest section of the region, led to&nbsp;the creation of NGC 3293 and IC 2581.&nbsp;Later episodes of star formation followed&nbsp;in regions lying progressively eastward and&nbsp;southward of these two clusters. “This rather&nbsp;simple picture does not account for all the&nbsp;observations,” the researchers warn, especially since there are some anomalous clusters in the region. No matter, it appears that&nbsp;NGC 3293 and IC 2581 represent one of the&nbsp;oldest areas of star formation in the association. But as G. Baume (University of Padova)&nbsp;and his colleagues report in a 2003 </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Astronomy and Astrophysics</span><span class="font19"> paper, 19 stars with&nbsp;signs of H-alpha emission in the region of&nbsp;NGC 3293, indicate that star formation is&nbsp;still active there.</span></p></td>

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Although Lacaille is credited with discovering the cluster NGC 3293 (it is the eighth “nebulous cluster” in his 1755 catalog), the&nbsp;object is part of the naked-eye backdrop of&nbsp;the Milky Way and no doubt was spied as&nbsp;an innocuous star by numerous wonder-struck aboriginal stargazers – history's first&nbsp;celestialtreasurehunters.WhenJamesDun-lop observed it on April 29, 1826, he saw&nbsp;“a very small cluster of very small bright&nbsp;stars; round figure, about 4<span class="font2"><sup>^</sup> </span><span class="font19">diameter; rich&nbsp;in extremely small stars resembling faint&nbsp;nebulosity.”</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Both Lacaille's and Dunlop's reference to nebulosity is curious, only because, as&nbsp;stated earlier, nebulosity is involved with the&nbsp;cluster at its northern edge. In their 1975&nbsp;“Catalogue of Southern stars embedded in&nbsp;nebulosity,” van den Bergh and Herbst list&nbsp;two reflection nebulae here: BHe 42A and&nbsp;BHe 42B. The first nebula surrounds the illuminating star and measures 4<span class="font2"><sup>^</sup> </span><span class="font19">across on red&nbsp;plates. The second nebula lies just to the&nbsp;north and west and measures 1.6</span><span class="font2"><sup>^</sup> </span><span class="font19">on the&nbsp;blue plates, where it is strongest. Colin S.&nbsp;Gum, also lists them as Gum 30 in his“A survey of Southern H II regions.” He gives the&nbsp;nebula a maximum diameter of 40</span><span class="font2"><sup>^</sup> </span><span class="font19">and rates&nbsp;it as being moderately bright against the&nbsp;background Milky Way. Interestingly, few&nbsp;observers have seen the nebulosity, and I&nbsp;have to wonder why.</span></p>

A long arm&nbsp;extending to the east, and a stubby one, end&nbsp;at a distinct triangle to the west. If you've&nbsp;gota pirate's eye, might not the cluster (with&nbsp;its strong central axis, arms, and sharp surrounding starlight) be a sterling silver crucifix wrapped in a crystal bead rosary – a&nbsp;treasure well worth pocketing on the way to&nbsp;the gallows.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">If you cannot see the nebula described above, don't fret, few have. But I find it is not&nbsp;apparent under magnification. It requires&nbsp;low power and averted vision, as well as the&nbsp;ability to differentiate nebulosity from Milky&nbsp;Way, which takes an experienced yet discerning eye. Try first in binoculars.

This inner ring marks the beginning&nbsp;of the spiral structure and the ring is dominated by a young stellar population.

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Seen in detailed images, the bar, not the bulge, dominates the galaxy's core. Close&nbsp;inspection of the inner ring and the initial&nbsp;spiral arms shows that the beginning parts&nbsp;of the spiral structure and its accompanying&nbsp;dust, in part, wrap tightly around the ring.&nbsp;This region is also dominated by a population of young stars, which is commonly seen&nbsp;in more typical barred spiral galaxies (see&nbsp;Hidden Treasure 51).</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Curiously, where the main spiral structure stops in the outer halo, astronomers have&nbsp;detectedaveryfaintpseudoring,which,sur-prisingly, is not centered on the nucleus.&nbsp;This outer pseudoring, like the inner ring,&nbsp;is populated by young stars, indicating that&nbsp;it has active star-forming regions. Typically, isolated spiral galaxies – those away&nbsp;from the gravitational tug of other systems, do not show such anomalies. Equally&nbsp;odd, the neutral hydrogen gas beyond this&nbsp;ring is warped. How did such complexities&nbsp;arise? In a 2000 <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Astronomy and Astrophysics&nbsp;</span><span class="font19">paper, L. Verrdes-Montenegro (Instituto de&nbsp;Astrofisic de Andalucia) and his colleagues&nbsp;suggest that the galaxy recently cannibalized another system, which warped and&nbsp;modified its outer disk. The prominent spiral arm on the southeast side, for instance,&nbsp;exhibits a definite warp. And a galactic-merger event is the most likely cause. Such a&nbsp;scenario would explain the relative rarity of&nbsp;suchcuriousfeaturesinanaveragelate-type&nbsp;spiral. The warping, however, could also be&nbsp;due to a near miss by an unknown passing&nbsp;object, or some massive internal energetic&nbsp;activity.</span></p></td>

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">From the dark skies of Hawaii, and I'm sure from other southerly locals in the continental USA, NGC 3621 is visible in 7 <span class="font5">× </span><span class="font19">50&nbsp;binoculars as a soft peach-like glow, even&nbsp;with the crescent Moon up. In my antique&nbsp;scope, it's a dim, blotted haze; the challenge in this star-poor region is to know&nbsp;exactly where to look. Telescopically, the&nbsp;galaxy appears as a big diffuse glow with a&nbsp;bright core and a faint, elliptical halo. Its spiral arms are faint and will challenge smalltelescope users. Still, Ernest J. Hartung notes&nbsp;that the spiral system is “quite easy, though&nbsp;faint,” in a 3-inch. He also found it “lying in&nbsp;a trapezium of four stars in good contrast&nbsp;with a scattered star field.”</span></p>

By moving my attention from&nbsp;my retina's periphery to its fovea, I can register several bright areas. First the nuclear&nbsp;region is a diffuse circular haze, like a fuzzy&nbsp;peach core. A bright nub of an arm extends&nbsp;to the south-southeast and, with time, I can&nbsp;followtwospiralarmsthatformabackwards&nbsp;S – one arm starts in the southeastern quadrant and loops around to the west and the&nbsp;other starts in the northwestern quadrant&nbsp;and loops around to the east.

Using&nbsp;a 10-inch Newtonian reflector under the&nbsp;dark rural skies of Potter Valley, California, Todd Hansen also notes the presence&nbsp;of these two lanes and arms. Two roughly&nbsp;13th-magnitude stars occupy the northwest&nbsp;flank of the galaxy and a sprig of dappled haziness lies just to the east.

Ironically, NGC 3628 is the more fascinating member of the Leo triplet.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Like several of our hidden treasures, NGC 3628 belongs to the Leo Spur of Galaxies. It&nbsp;has a linear diameter of 78,000 light-years&nbsp;and a total mass of 135 billion Suns, so it is&nbsp;similar in physical size toNGC 3521 (Hidden&nbsp;Treasure 56). The galaxy is not without its&nbsp;peculiarities. For instance, it has two equatorial planes, marked by dark matter tilted&nbsp;year-long stellar tail or plume extending to&nbsp;the south from NGC 3628 – another product of the tidal effects.

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">The presence of a nuclear starburst has made NGC 3628 a popular target for X-ray observations. Einstein observations of&nbsp;the galaxy detected two X-ray sources, one&nbsp;of which was coincident with the nucleus,&nbsp;together with a bright X-ray outflow aligned&nbsp;along the minor axis of the galaxy. The central X-ray source lies about 1 kiloparsec from&nbsp;the nucleus and may be an intermediatemass black hole candidate. This source has&nbsp;no known optical, infrared, or radio counterpart. It is also extremely variable. At a&nbsp;June 2001 American Astronomical Society&nbsp;meeting, David K. Strickland ( John Hopkins University) notes that this source “is&nbsp;clearly another example of an intermediate&nbsp;luminosity X-ray object, very similar to the&nbsp;most-luminous X-ray source in M82 that has&nbsp;attracted so much attention.”</p>

When William&nbsp;Herschel discovered this system in 1785, he&nbsp;had no idea what a chaotic wonder he had&nbsp;found.

By the 1960s, astronomers were&nbsp;imaging a barlike core with dark markings&nbsp;and traces of spiral structure with highly&nbsp;resolved whorls. Gerard and Antoinette de&nbsp;Voucouleurs and Hal Corwin first classified&nbsp;it as an S-shaped Magellanic-type irregular&nbsp;in 1976.

The data support Huchra and&nbsp;Geller's suspicion that the massive star formation in NGC 4214's core is the result of an&nbsp;interaction, possibly a tidal encounter, with&nbsp;one or more dwarf companions.</span></p></td>

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">In 1997 NGC 4214 was imaged with the Hubble Space Telescope's Wide Field Planetary Camera 2. The image shows an amorphous bloody-yellow mess – like a yellow&nbsp;amoeba that's been hit by a truck. What the&nbsp;image actually shows is a highly resolved&nbsp;view of the star formation across the galaxy's&nbsp;face. Filigreed clouds of glowing gas surround at least six bright blue star clusters –&nbsp;the youngest of which are probably less than&nbsp;10millionyearsold–inthegalaxy'ssouthern&nbsp;flank. The fast “stellar winds” flowing away&nbsp;from these young, hot objects attain speeds&nbsp;of thousands of miles per second and literally blow bubbles in the surrounding gas.&nbsp;Over millions of years, the bubbles increase&nbsp;in size as the stars inside them grow older.&nbsp;The activity is so great in this galaxy that&nbsp;it is sometimes referred to as a Wolf-Rayet&nbsp;Galaxy. These bubbles are due to the fact&nbsp;that most massive stars in a starburst&nbsp;spend a large fraction of their lives buried&nbsp;inside their original molecular cloud. We are&nbsp;seeing them just as they are emerging from&nbsp;this envelope.</p>

John's description of NGC 4228 was&nbsp;‘very faint, large, round with a gradually&nbsp;brighter middle,' which almost sounds like&nbsp;a different object? Since nothing else is&nbsp;nearby, John must have made a positional&nbsp;mistake.”</p></td>

It is ever&nbsp;so slightly oriented northwest–southeast. At&nbsp;first, the disk may appear uniform in brightness, but with averted vision it gets progressively brighter toward the middle, though&nbsp;not to a sharp stellar point. The inner core is&nbsp;simply a bright oval of light within a fainter&nbsp;one. At 72</span><span class="font5">×</span><span class="font19">, the inner oval seems mottled.&nbsp;With time and concentration I can make&nbsp;out a dual core – two fuzzy pearls of light.&nbsp;Smyth could not make these out, noting&nbsp;that, “despite all my coaxing, I was unable&nbsp;to see the two remarkable nuclei, so beautifully figured by [Herschel].” Clearly, then,&nbsp;despite Herschel's catalog description in the&nbsp;table above, he was the first to break up&nbsp;the galaxy's components before the advent&nbsp;of photography. Equally interesting, Luginbuhl and Skiff, saw only a “diffuse central&nbsp;pip” with a 10-inch telescope.</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">At 101 <span class="font5">×</span><span class="font19">, the twin nuclei are flanked to the southeast by an even fainter glow.

The overall beauty of the&nbsp;galaxy in small telescopes begins to be lost&nbsp;at this power, though careful study of the&nbsp;outer lens does reveal its boxy shape. The&nbsp;object must be a marvel in larger instruments. As Ron Buta describes in the Webb&nbsp;Society's </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Deep-Sky Handbook</span><span class="font19"> ( Volume 4),&nbsp;NGC 4214 through a 30-inch telescope&nbsp;appears “[b]right, mottled and fan-shaped&nbsp;with a wisp on one end which ends ina double knot; six very faint very small knots line&nbsp;the major axis, including what appears tobe&nbsp;a conspicuous nucleus.”</span></p></td></tr></table><hr><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"><img src="Hidden Treasures_files/Hidden Treasures-273.jpg" style="width:389pt;height:512pt;"/></div><br clear="all">

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Today, images of NGC 4216 are often used in textbooks to illustrate the classic&nbsp;components of a typical, middle-aged Sb&nbsp;spiral galaxy. The galaxy displays a small,&nbsp;extremely bright nucleus partially hidden&nbsp;by dark lanes. A fuzzy halo of light, as soft&nbsp;and transparent as angels' breath marks the&nbsp;position of the galaxy's central bulge. Knotty,&nbsp;regular arms swirl away from this core in&nbsp;luminous concentric rings lined with very&nbsp;strong dark lanes. The outer regions of the&nbsp;disk are very dusty. The intensity of the&nbsp;nucleus and the symmetry of the rings gives&nbsp;the galaxy a look of quiet calamity.</p></td>

As early as 1979, John Kormendy&nbsp;NGC 4216's nucleus is about twice as young&nbsp;as its bulge. It is thought that the age of the&nbsp;nucleus is 8 to 12 billion years, while the&nbsp;bulge of the galaxy is older by a factor of 1.5&nbsp;to 2. The astronomers also found spectral&nbsp;evidence for starburst activity which may&nbsp;form a circumnuclear ring in the plane of&nbsp;the galaxy's disk.

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">NGC 4216 is all the more stunning at higher powers.

And at 101</span><span class="font5">×</span><span class="font19">, the brilliant&nbsp;nucleus lies at the center of a white eggshaped core beyond which extends the&nbsp;oblique and dynamic lens. Smyth makes&nbsp;an interesting comment about the visibility&nbsp;of the galaxy's nucleus as the eyes work to&nbsp;absorb its photons: “and the centre exhibits&nbsp;a palpable nucleus, which in my instrument&nbsp;brightens at intervals, as the eye rallies.”&nbsp;As Smyth's observing eye weaved back and&nbsp;forth like a shuttle across the length of the&nbsp;galaxy, the nucleus flared to prominence,&nbsp;then dimmed, in accordance to where its&nbsp;light focused on his retina. If you spend&nbsp;some time surveying the galaxy's length at&nbsp;101</span><span class="font5">×</span><span class="font19">, see too if the major axis doesn't seem&nbsp;to suddenly and occasionally fluoresce – like&nbsp;a pulsating neon tube light.

Anandarao (Physical Research Laboratory, Navrangpura, Ahmedabad, India) add&nbsp;another symmetrical axis, arguing that&nbsp;NGC 4361 has quadrupolar flows – most&nbsp;likely produced by a precessing equatorial&nbsp;disk. The interaction of these symmetrical&nbsp;outflows with the halo has, in the words&nbsp;of Vazquez, “already produced notorious&nbsp;signs of deformation in the [halo].” Careful&nbsp;inspection of the planetary's halo reveals it&nbsp;to have a complex curdled appearance, as&nbsp;if some unseen hand has stirred this brew&nbsp;of tenuous vapors with a stick. In a sense&nbsp;it has.

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">The most difficult aspectofobservingthis planetary with a small telescope is the low&nbsp;contrast between the arms and the surrounding halo. If you have difficulty, try lowering the magnification.

<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">So it's best to study this object with a variety of magnifications over different nights. The more you get acquainted with this&nbsp;object, the more you'll see, and the easier the task will become to see the finer&nbsp;details. Overall, aside from the central star,&nbsp;the most obvious feature is a knot on the&nbsp;south-southwest arm, which forms the end&nbsp;of a “bar” of material that eventually sweeps&nbsp;round to the west. Another knot on the&nbsp;opposite side, but farther out from the central star, is similarly shaped; but its material sweeps from the northeast to the eastnortheast. That's where it touches a fan of&nbsp;material that forms the eastern clover leaf.&nbsp;A dimmer clover leaf, the faintest of them&nbsp;all, lies to the west. The overall shape of the&nbsp;nebula is indeed round, which is best seen&nbsp;at low powers. But at high powers, this planetary for all intents and purposes looks like&nbsp;a barred spiral galaxy. There is no mistaking the similarity. The lobes of each clover&nbsp;are not of a uniform light, they appear mottled, and they are not evenly lit. It is quite&nbsp;thefeatheryjumbleof whirling gases, a most&nbsp;complex sight, and perhaps one of the most&nbsp;visually bizarre planetaries visible in small&nbsp;telescopes.</p>

Like Berenice's hair, Pope&nbsp;sees Fermor's hair (which he disguised as&nbsp;“Belinda's hair” in the poem) fleeing into&nbsp;the sky: “A sudden Star, it shot thro' liquid&nbsp;Air, / And drew behind a radiant Trail of&nbsp;Hair. / Not Berenice's Locks first rose so&nbsp;bright, / The heav'ns bespangling with&nbsp;dishevel'd light.” Pope explained the reason for writing the poem: “The stealing of&nbsp;Miss Belle Fermor's hair, was taken too seriously, and caused an estrangement between</span></p></td></tr></table><hr><div style="float:left;layout-flow:horizontal;"><img src="Hidden Treasures_files/Hidden Treasures-284.jpg" style="width:256pt;height:213pt;"/></div>

Several cultures saw it as a laurel&nbsp;or wreath. In ancient China,&nbsp;the stars in and around&nbsp;Coma Berenices – including&nbsp;the tail of Leo, the torso of&nbsp;Virgo, and the stars of Canes&nbsp;Venatici – were a scene at&nbsp;the royal court. In the center of the court was the&nbsp;royal prince, T'ai-tsze, surrounded byall hisdignitaries.&nbsp;Regardless of the confusion,&nbsp;we have to thank the great</p>

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;">the two families, though they had lived so long in great friendship before. A common&nbsp;acquaintance and well-wisher to both [John&nbsp;Caryll], desired me to write a poem to make&nbsp;a jest of it, and laugh them together again. It&nbsp;was with this view that I wrote <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">The Rape of&nbsp;the Lock.”</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">The stars of Coma Berenices have not always belonged to Berenice. In the third-century bc, Eratosthenes first alluded to the&nbsp;groupingastheLockofAriadne(orAriadne's&nbsp;Hair), which he says is “near the tail of the&nbsp;Lion.” Ptolemy also recognized the group as&nbsp;a “lock” of hair, but this hair belonged to&nbsp;Leo, the Lion, and was not recorded as one&nbsp;of his original 48 constellations. Indeed Arabian astronomers long knew it as either Al&nbsp;Halbah or Al Dafirah, which refer to either&nbsp;“The Coarse Hair” or “The Tuft” (the bushy&nbsp;tip) of the Lion's Tail. In his <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Cycle of Celestial&nbsp;Objects</span><span class="font19">, Adm. William Henry Smyth writes,&nbsp;“Old Thomas Hill, in his </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Schoole of Skil</span><span class="font19">, 1599,&nbsp;calls these sacred tresses by the homely designation of Berenice's Bush; and there has&nbsp;been a name still homelier.” Bayer depicts&nbsp;Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe (1546–&nbsp;1601) for first recording its position and&nbsp;fixing it as a distinct constellation in his&nbsp;1602 catalog. Johann Bayer adopted Tycho's&nbsp;usage of Coma Berenices in his 1603&nbsp;</span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Uranometria</span><span class="font19">.</span></p></td>

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">In his book <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">The New Patterns in the Sky: Myths and Legends of the Stars</span><span class="font19">, Julius D. W.&nbsp;Staal shares an old Babylonian story, related&nbsp;by Ovid, that tells how the stars of Coma&nbsp;Berenices came to be. Two lovers, Pyramus&nbsp;and Thisbe, decided to meet in secret one&nbsp;evening at a spring near the edge of the forest. Thisbe arrived first, but she was fright-enedawaybyalioncarrying its dead prey. As&nbsp;she ran, she lost her veil, which fluttered past&nbsp;the lion, who angrily snatched at it, staining&nbsp;the veil with blood. When Pyramus arrived&nbsp;at the scene, the lion had gone, but Pyra-mus immediately recognized Thisbe's veil.&nbsp;Seeing the blood and the mauled carcass&nbsp;nearby, Pyramus feared the worst. Blaming&nbsp;himself for the tragedy, he kissed the bloodstained veil, drew his sword, then plunged it&nbsp;deep into his heart. His limp body fell at the&nbsp;foot of a mulberry tree, whose roots thirstily&nbsp;absorbed the oozing blood, which caused its&nbsp;fruits to turn dark red. Unable to find help,&nbsp;Thisbe returned to the forest only to find her&nbsp;beloved Pyramus dead. Grasping Pyramus'&nbsp;sword, Thisbe plunged it deep into her side&nbsp;then swiftly joined her lover. To honor the&nbsp;pair for their devotion, Jupiter put Thisbe's&nbsp;veil among the stars, where it still “flutters&nbsp;today in the stars of Coma Berenices, wafted&nbsp;by an eternal cosmic breeze.”</span></p></td></tr></table><hr>

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">John Landseer (1769–1852), an English writer on archeological astronomy, says&nbsp;that, based on the study of an Assyrian symbolic monument, the seven brightest stars&nbsp;Coma Berenices were seen as a Dove; and&nbsp;since the first of these stars rise with the&nbsp;last bright star of Argus (the Ship [Noah's&nbsp;Ark]), as well as rising simultaneously with&nbsp;the hands of Bootes, the Herdsman, Landseer believes that Coma Berenices, not the&nbsp;Pleiades, is better associated with the tale&nbsp;of the Biblical flood as written in the stars –&nbsp;this, he argues, would solve the mystery of&nbsp;the missing Pleiad.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">In my youth, I preferred to see Coma Berenices as a spider's web stretched across&nbsp;the void between Canes Venatici, Leo,&nbsp;Virgo, and Bootes. Although I grew up in&nbsp;what is now light-polluted Cambridge, Massachusetts, this sparkling array of dim suns&nbsp;was certainly bright enough to snare my&nbsp;imagination; such a view of it would not&nbsp;be possible today from my old backyard&nbsp;(unless there wasa power failure on the East&nbsp;Coast); but at least I have those sentimental memories, which I can now relive from&nbsp;my new home. Garret Serviss also imagined&nbsp;a cobweb here, writing, “One might think&nbsp;the old woman of the nursery rhyme who&nbsp;went to sweep the cobwebs out of the sky&nbsp;had skipped this corner, or else that its delicate beauty had preserved it even from her&nbsp;housewifely instinct.”</p></td>
<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">While Coma Berenices has long been noticed as a conspicuous gathering of stars,&nbsp;its true nature was not revealed until 1938&nbsp;when R. J. Trumpler identified 37 stars as&nbsp;true cluster members. But P. J. Melotte had&nbsp;already listed it as the 111th object in his&nbsp;1915 <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Catalog of Star Clusters</span><span class="font19">, which is why&nbsp;it retains the catalog name of Melotte 111.</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Melotte 111 is very young, having an estimated age between 400 and 600 million years – about the time when the first winged&nbsp;insects appeared on Earth. For a cluster that&nbsp;is so close, it is relatively dim. It is also relatively poor in stars, containing some 270&nbsp;members ranging from magnitude 5 to 10.5;&nbsp;that's about a quarter of the number of stars&nbsp;found in the Pleiades. No fainter members&nbsp;have been detected. As R. J. Garcia Lopez&nbsp;(Astrophysical Institute of the Canaries) and&nbsp;his colleagues suggest in a 2000 <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Astronomy&nbsp;andAstrophysics</span><span class="font19"> paper, the Coma Berenices&nbsp;Cluster may not have enough mass to retain&nbsp;its less massive original stars, such as red&nbsp;dwarfs, which have long since escaped into&nbsp;space. The mass of the cluster is probably&nbsp;under 100 solar masses, and its density is&nbsp;about one star per 10 parsecs. The members we see today are arranged in a roughly&nbsp;triangular shape that spans 10 Moon diameters in extent (22.5 light-years). The cluster&nbsp;contains no giant stars, though the brightest members are just beginning to evolve&nbsp;toward the giant stage. The cluster is intrinsically only slightly brighter than the Sun,&nbsp;meaning that if we could place the Sun at&nbsp;the distance of the Coma Berenices Cluster,&nbsp;it would shine with the brilliance of a 1st-magnitude star.</span></p>

The most prominent one is 17 Comae, but 16 Comae has four dim companions that make an attractive sight, like&nbsp;a dangling earring with a large central diamond. The entire cluster is fractured into&nbsp;mini asterisms that seem&nbsp;to float in the darkness&nbsp;like letters in alphabet soup.&nbsp;More than 100 stars can be&nbsp;seen with a casual glance&nbsp;in the triangular portion&nbsp;formed by 12, 14, and 17, the&nbsp;region around and Gamma&nbsp;Comae. But it's amazing how&nbsp;utterly “clean” the cluster&nbsp;looks through the 4-inch at&nbsp;23<span class="font5">×</span><span class="font19">, just a scrim of stars&nbsp;beyond which lies a black&nbsp;and empty stage. In a local&nbsp;sense, this is simply due to&nbsp;an uncommon perspective;&nbsp;unlike most open clusters,&nbsp;the Coma Berenices Cluster is as far as one can&nbsp;get away from the stellar&nbsp;pandemonium of the Milky&nbsp;Way's disk. In other words,&nbsp;it lies only about 5</span><span class="font2"><sup>◦</sup> </span><span class="font19">west&nbsp;of the North Galactic Pole –&nbsp;the point where our galaxy's&nbsp;axis of rotation intersects the&nbsp;north celestial sphere. In a&nbsp;universal sense, this background emptiness is an illusion, for the region is on the&nbsp;western fringe of the great&nbsp;Coma Berenices Cluster of&nbsp;Galaxies, a turbulent array&nbsp;of more than 3,000 galaxies (mostly ellipticals and&nbsp;lenticulars), 280 million light-years distant. It is the nearest&nbsp;massive cluster of galaxies and is scattered&nbsp;across 20 million light-years of space.</span></p>

Combined with other evidence Clemens and his&nbsp;colleagues suggest that NGC 4490 is a young&nbsp;galaxy with an age of approximately 2 billion years, and that it has had an approximately constant star-formation rate during this period equal to the current rate&nbsp;of about 4.7 solar masses per year. They&nbsp;also note that the effects of the interaction&nbsp;between the two galaxies have not had sufficient time to affect the star-formation rate&nbsp;in NGC 4490 significantly, although NGC&nbsp;4485, which is about eight times less massive, has been severely affected by the interaction. In fact, most star formation is occurring </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">between</span><span class="font19"> the two galaxies. Radio observations show a ridge of neutral hydrogen&nbsp;gas extending from NGC 4490 toward NGC&nbsp;4485; this feature coincides with a previously known chain of giant H-II regions.</span></p></td>

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">One of the most striking results from the Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS) survey was that interacting galaxies appear&nbsp;commonly to show significantly stronger&nbsp;far-infrared emission, presumably from star&nbsp;formation, than do similar non-interacting&nbsp;galaxies. Indeed, it has been suggested that&nbsp;“ultraluminous” galaxies and quasars might&nbsp;be the result of a collision between a pair of&nbsp;gas-rich galaxies.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Interestingly, the nineteenth-century British observer, Rev. T.W. Webb described&nbsp;NGC 4490 as a “[l]ong, easily resolvable”&nbsp;nebula. Indeed, the galaxy's size, shape, and&nbsp;brightness rival those of some of the more&nbsp;fashionable Messier galaxies in neighboring&nbsp;Coma Berenices, such as M88, M99, and&nbsp;M100. At a distance of 25 million light-years,&nbsp;however, NGC 4490 is half as far away as&nbsp;they are and, with a diameter of 35,500&nbsp;light-years, less than half as big.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">In high-resolution images taken with large telescopes, we see that NGC 4490 is&nbsp;inclined65<span class="font2"><sup>◦</sup> </span><span class="font19">fromface-onandisamostfasci-nating system with a ring-tail core wrapped&nbsp;in a cocoon of stellar filigree and H-II&nbsp;regions. The galaxy's northwest end looks&nbsp;warped, and it is here that bizarre drips&nbsp;of starlight make a dogleg to the north, to&nbsp;yet another a pool of tortured nebulosity&nbsp;surrounding the galaxy's companion, NGC&nbsp;4485. In these images NGC 4490 looks like&nbsp;an eviscerated galaxy – one whose entrails&nbsp;have been ghoulishly ripped from the carcass and tossed wildly asunder.</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Both components show massive, robust star formation over their faces. Individual&nbsp;stars begin to resolve at about 18th magnitude in each galaxy, but the surface brightness is so high over most of their disks as&nbsp;to make the photometry of individual stars&nbsp;difficult. Also there is much dust over NGC&nbsp;4490's face.</p>

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;">“There's a saying among prospectors: ‘Go out looking for one thing, and that's all you'll ever find'.” I love these words&nbsp;by legendary documentary filmmaker&nbsp;Robert Flaherty (1884–1951), because they&nbsp;apply to prospectors of all kinds, including&nbsp;us celestial treasure hunters. Consider&nbsp;the relatively recent discovery of McNeil's&nbsp;Nebula. On January 23, 2004, Jay McNeil of&nbsp;West Paducah, Kentucky, discovered a new&nbsp;nebula in Orion. He found the diminutive&nbsp;1<span class="font2"><sup>^</sup> </span><span class="font19">-diameter nebula (which shines at 15th&nbsp;magnitude) on a charge coupled device&nbsp;(CCD) image of M78; he took the discovery&nbsp;image from his backyard with a 3-inch&nbsp;refractor. But as McNeil stresses, “It wasn't&nbsp;me, ‘an imager,' that made the discovery.&nbsp;It was me, ‘an observer.' It was 20 years&nbsp;behind the eyepiece. The new nebula was&nbsp;much brighter than any of the other objects&nbsp;I had observed visually around M78.”</span></p></td>
<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">McNeil's discovery was not “accidental.” It demanded a certain level of knowledge&nbsp;and visual perspicacity. Indeed, between&nbsp;the time McNeil's Nebula turned on (some&nbsp;time between October 28 and November 15,&nbsp;2003 – owing to a flare up of its illuminating&nbsp;star) more than 20 astrophotographers had&nbsp;imaged M78 and its surroundings; but only&nbsp;McNeil's acumen noticed the new nebula.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">That same visual acumen was at work when Robert Grant Aitken (1864–1951) discovered our next hidden treasure, the planetary nebula IC 3568. Aitken, who worked&nbsp;at Lick Observatory from 1895 to 1935, specialized in observations of double stars, discovering 3,100 new pairs. He also measured&nbsp;positions of comets, and that's how he came&nbsp;to discover his one and only nebula. On&nbsp;the night of August 31, 1900, Aitken was&nbsp;using the observatory's 12-Clark-Refractor&nbsp;to examine Comet Borrelly–Brooks, when&nbsp;he noticed that the star BD <span class="font5">+</span><span class="font19">83</span><span class="font2"><sup>◦</sup> </span><span class="font19">357</span><span class="font2"><sup>^</sup> </span><span class="font19">in&nbsp;Camelopardalis was surrounded by a small&nbsp;circular nebula. He confirmed the nebula's appearance with the 36-inch refractor the next night. In 1918, Heber Curtis&nbsp;described its photographic appearance as&nbsp;a “perfectly round disk fading out a little at&nbsp;the edges.” Direct photographs of it taken&nbsp;by R. Minkowski with the 200-inch reflector showed it to consist of a small bright&nbsp;ring with an outer envelope that faded away&nbsp;smoothly.</span></p></td></tr></table><hr>

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">In a 1969 <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Astrophysical Journal</span><span class="font19"> article, Paul Lee (Louisiana State University), Lawrence Aller (University of California, Los&nbsp;Angeles), and their colleagues noted that&nbsp;the symmetrical appearance of this nebula&nbsp;makes it the closest approximation to the&nbsp;“oft-mentioned theoretician's planetary.” In&nbsp;other words, as Bruce Balick (University of&nbsp;Washington, Seattle) explained in 1996, “If&nbsp;IC 3568 did not exist, it might have been&nbsp;created by theoreticians,” thus the planetary's nickname. Ironically, in 1973, the&nbsp;object was misclassified as a compact galaxy&nbsp;(UGC 7731) in the 1973 </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Uppsala General&nbsp;Catalogue.</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">No matter, to this day IC 3568 is considered one of the most circularly symmetric of all planetary nebulae. It is also one of the&nbsp;morphologically simplest planetaries in the&nbsp;sky. The nebula, which measures 0.3 light-years across in true physical extent, was&nbsp;imaged in stunning clarity by the Hubble&nbsp;Space Telescope. Here we see the nebula's&nbsp;magnitude 12.3 central star surrounded by&nbsp;a bright inner sphere with smooth edges&nbsp;and a complex internal structure – namely&nbsp;a series of symmetrical linear features radiating outward from the central star. A very&nbsp;smooth, faint halo surrounds this bright&nbsp;region. It appears slightly brighter in the</p></td>

The inner halo measures roughly&nbsp;visible in small telescopes. How does it&nbsp;appear in larger telescopes?

It achieved a maximum&nbsp;brightness of magnitude 11.8 and was captured in outburst with the HST; since Type&nbsp;Ia supernovae are the best standard candles in the universe, observing the event's&nbsp;rise and fall in brightness, as well as its&nbsp;color, can help astronomers to plumb the&nbsp;depths of the universe. If all Type Ia supernovae have the same intrinsic brightness,&nbsp;then the brighter a supernova appears, the&nbsp;closer it must be, and vice versa. Observations of several other extragalactic Type Ia&nbsp;supernovae have proven the case. But the&nbsp;initial studies of Supernova 1994d showed&nbsp;it to be anonymously bright for a Type Ia&nbsp;event. Drenkhan and Richtier argue that's&nbsp;because astronomers used the fact that the&nbsp;galaxy is a member of the Virgo Cluster.&nbsp;When Drenkhan and Richtier analyzed the&nbsp;light curve of Supernova 1994d using their&nbsp;newly derived distance of 40 million light-years, they found it to be a bright but normal Type Ia supernova. Based on their studies, I have adopted a distance of 40 mil-</p></td>

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Observations near the location of SN1994d in 1995 with the William Herschel&nbsp;Telescope at La Palma, and 21-centimeter&nbsp;spectra obtained with the 100-meter Effel-berg Radiotelescope, indicate calcium II&nbsp;and sodium absorption produced in interstellar gas in this region. This is the first&nbsp;detection of interstellar absorption originating in a galaxy of early morphological&nbsp;type. The gas appears to have near-solar&nbsp;abundances with very low dust content&nbsp;and is consistent with galactic models&nbsp;in which hot gas is expelled into the&nbsp;outer galactic halo and then subsequently&nbsp;cools.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;padding:0pt 0pt 2pt 0pt;">In images taken by Edwin Hubble in the 1960s, the galaxy appears as a fuzzy elliptical object with a boxy bulge (slightly asymmetric), a diffuse central lens with a hint of&nbsp;spiral structure and a whisker of darkness&nbsp;along its major axis. Observations with the&nbsp;60-inch telescope at Mt. Wilson show the&nbsp;presence of an internal ring of dust that is&nbsp;buried deep within the main body of the&nbsp;galaxy. This internal structure is an obscuration of material rather than a bright spiral&nbsp;arm of the galaxy. The outer disk is nothing&nbsp;but a highly amorphous ellipse.</p></td></tr></table><hr>

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;">Larry mitchell of the houston Astronomical Society first introduced me to&nbsp;NGC 4656 during the 1998 Texas Star Party.&nbsp;He calls it the Hockey Stick Galaxy, while his&nbsp;observing compatriot Barbara Wilson refers&nbsp;to it as The Hook. After seeing this galaxy&nbsp;through their large reflectors, I understand&nbsp;both monikers. But I have made one revision. I have since added the name Messier&nbsp;to Larry's Hockey Stick. Charles Messier&nbsp;had nothing to do with the discovery of&nbsp;NGC 4656 but he did discover deep-sky&nbsp;objects. No, the name Messier in this case&nbsp;refers to Canadian-born hockey star Mark&nbsp;Messier, who, among other triumphs, led&nbsp;the New York Rangers to win the 1994 Stanley Cup Championship. Messier also just happens to have a very appropriate last name&nbsp;to be tagged onto a celestial hockey stick.</p></td>

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">NGC 4656 is a large system, with a physical diameter of 91,000 light-years. It belongs to the Coma–Sculptor Cloud of Galaxies and&nbsp;is receding from us at about 650 kilometers&nbsp;per second. A glance at just about any photograph of the galaxy reveals it to be highly&nbsp;asymmetrical in brightness, with the northeast half much brighter than the southwest&nbsp;half. In long-exposure images the galaxy&nbsp;resolves into a smattering of stars and H-II&nbsp;regions, the brightest of which lie approximately 18<span class="font2"><sup>^^</sup> </span><span class="font19">west of the apparent nucleus.&nbsp;Indeed, the galaxy is very active in star formation, but with most of the current activity&nbsp;concentrated to the nuclear region and the&nbsp;warped appendage.</span></p></td>
<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Known as NGC 4657, the appendage juts out at right angles to the main shaft like the&nbsp;light-years apart on the plane of the sky. Wilson likens these interacting spirals to “two&nbsp;ships nearly crashing in the night, both listing from the encounter, with [NGC] 4656&nbsp;definitely the loser, but [NGC] 4631 . . . not&nbsp;unscathed.”</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Given the pirate theme of this book, I would add that, in images, NGC 4656&nbsp;appears to be the victim of pirate attack.&nbsp;The ship's plundered hull has been blasted&nbsp;asunder. The dim southwestern segment of&nbsp;NGC 4656 is the ship's sunken bow seen&nbsp;through the shallow waters of some treacherous reef. Its battered stern remains helpless high above the waterline.

<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">On clear and transparent evenings, NGC 4656 is visible in the 4-inch at 23<span class="font5">×&nbsp;</span><span class="font19">as a thin shaft of light.&nbsp;Observers' impressions of it&nbsp;vary, revealing that its visibility is sensitive to atmospheric conditions and light&nbsp;pollution. While Brian Skiff&nbsp;and Christian Luginbuhl say&nbsp;it is “barely visible” in a 2 </span><span class="font17"><sup>1</sup><sub>2</sub> </span><span class="font19">-inch telescope, Ernst Hartung, observing from Australia writes that it is “not&nbsp;suited” to small apertures.&nbsp;And while I agree that NGC&nbsp;4656 will be a wash for even&nbsp;suburban observers, or that&nbsp;it might appear less-than-impressive if poorly posi-tionedinadarksky,observers&nbsp;under reasonably dark skies shouldn't have&nbsp;difficulty seeing it, especially since its&nbsp;nuclear region is brighter than NGC 4631's.</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">If you're having trouble pinpointing the galaxy, center NGC 4631 and look southeast of its eastern flank. There you should&nbsp;see a 30<span class="font2"><sup>^</sup> </span><span class="font19">-long chain of five 11th- to 12th-magnitude stars heading toward the southeast. NGC 4656 is immediately southwest of&nbsp;the southernmost star in the chain, oriented&nbsp;northeast–southwest. It is a dim glow at 23</span><span class="font5">×</span><span class="font19">,&nbsp;all the more so when seen next to NGC 4631&nbsp;in the same field. But if you concentrate with&nbsp;averted vision, the galaxy does not appear&nbsp;uniformly lit. Like M82 in Ursa Major, it&nbsp;appears segmented, like three ghosts walking toward you hand in hand. At 72</span><span class="font5">× </span><span class="font19">and&nbsp;with averted vision, the galaxy's segments&nbsp;are more enhanced. The brightest segment&nbsp;appears just northeast of where it seems&nbsp;the nucleus should be. There is a slightly&nbsp;fainter “oval” of light adjacent to what may&nbsp;be considered its nuclear region; the galaxy&nbsp;is very faint on the southwestern side of the&nbsp;“nuclear region” and looks like a dim tentacle of light. In a fanciful way, the galaxy&nbsp;looks likea squid, and David Levy calls it the&nbsp;Hummingbird; indeed, in photographs, the&nbsp;galaxy looks like the body of a hummingbird&nbsp;hovering over an invisible flower. The hummingbird's beak then would be NGC 4657,&nbsp;the appendage that juts out at right angles&nbsp;to the main shaft like the hooked blade of a&nbsp;hockey stick. I could detect NGC 4657 in the&nbsp;4-inch at 101</span><span class="font5">× </span><span class="font19">from the 12,000-foot level of&nbsp;Mauna Kea. Mitchell adds that the galaxy's&nbsp;largest H-II region has an angular diameter of 11 arcseconds. “This is large,” he says,&nbsp;“and should be easily resolved in modest&nbsp;sized telescopes. Try a nebula filter.”</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Given its initial apparent faintness, NGC 4656 is truly a remarkable object once you&nbsp;sit down and begin to study it behind the&nbsp;eyepiece, even in a small telescope, under a&nbsp;dark sky. Taking the time to really study this&nbsp;object will help any observer sharpen his or&nbsp;her visual acuity. You just have to dedicate&nbsp;yourself to the task and don't give up. I would&nbsp;also recommend observing this galaxy over&nbsp;the course of several nights. I will guarantee that any observer who does, will walk&nbsp;away from the telescope more gratified each&nbsp;night.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">If you are having any trouble believing that NGC 4656 is worth one's while, consider that it is only 0.5-magnitude&nbsp;fainter than M108 in Ursa Major and only&nbsp;0.4-magnitude fainter than M98 in Coma&nbsp;Berenices. Besides, since NGC 4656 is in&nbsp;the same low-power field of view as NGC&nbsp;4361, how can anyone <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">not</span><span class="font19"> want to see it?&nbsp;There is little in the night sky that compares with the sight of two relatively bright,&nbsp;nearly edge-on galaxies in the same field of&nbsp;view. It is quite a remarkable and uncommon view. As Mitchell says, “NGC 4656 is&nbsp;one of my favorites. I never get tired of&nbsp;looking at this object and every time I see&nbsp;it I swear I see something in it I never&nbsp;have before – a truly fascinating stop in the&nbsp;heavens.”</span></p></td></tr></table><hr><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"><img src="Hidden Treasures_files/Hidden Treasures-309.jpg" style="width:389pt;height:512pt;"/></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all">

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;">ngc 4699 is a small but very bright multiple-arm, mixed spiral galaxy.

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">In form, it is somewhat reminiscent of NGC 2841 (Hidden Treasure 49), whose disk&nbsp;is fragmented into countless arcs of matter with no clear spiral structure. While&nbsp;NGC 4699's disk is broken into fragments,&nbsp;the structure is more uniform than that in&nbsp;NGC 2841, and a spiral structure can be&nbsp;detected. The spiral-arm fragments exist&nbsp;over the entire face of the galaxy, which is&nbsp;projected 41<span class="font2"><sup>◦</sup> </span><span class="font19">from face-on.

<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">In the central lens the spiral structure appears bright and tightly wound.

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">In the surrounding disk, the spiral structure is more apparent, especially since the arms are dimmer and looser. They appear&nbsp;to be unwinding gradually outward. The&nbsp;galaxy also has a large number of outer,&nbsp;low-surface-brightness spiral fragments in&nbsp;the region where the intensity of the bright&nbsp;bulge decreases sharply as it merges with&nbsp;the fainter disk. Close inspection of high-resolution images reveals an asymmetry in&nbsp;the spiral pattern on either side ofthe bulge,&nbsp;suggesting that dust is a significant component of the spiral pattern. The disk is also&nbsp;filled with H-II regions, more than 100 of&nbsp;which have been detected.</p></td></tr></table><hr>

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">In short-exposures, the nucleus is a very small and very bright starlike object in a&nbsp;weak bar. However, the emission of the&nbsp;nucleus is very weak in this Seyfert-like&nbsp;galaxy. In a 1993 <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Astrophysical Journal&nbsp;</span><span class="font19">paper, Gary Bower (University of Michigan)&nbsp;and his colleagues discuss their search for&nbsp;a supermassive black hole in the nucleus&nbsp;of NGC 4699 and other nearby galaxies. Quasars and active galactic nuclei are&nbsp;believed to be powered by accretion of matter onto a central supermassive black hole,&nbsp;which is required to have a mass of 10 million solar masses. If the host galaxy exhausts&nbsp;the matter capable of feeding the black hole,&nbsp;the energy output rapidly decreases leaving behind a dead quasar engine. Given&nbsp;NGC 4699's bright starlike core but weak&nbsp;nuclear emission, it's possible that such a&nbsp;quasar corpse exists here. Although Bower&nbsp;and his colleagues' results were inconclusive, the researchers do not rule out the presence of a 10-million-solar-mass black hole&nbsp;at the center of NGC 4699.</span></p></td>
<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">NGC 4699 was neglected by professional astronomers until the discovery of a 17th-magnitude Type II supernova on June 6,&nbsp;1983, which flared to visibility 148<span class="font2"><sup>^^</sup> </span><span class="font19">east and&nbsp;131</span><span class="font2"><sup>^^</sup> </span><span class="font19">north of the nucleus. Type II supernovae occur at the end of a massive star's&nbsp;lifetime, when its nuclear fuel is exhausted&nbsp;and the star is no longer supported by the&nbsp;release of nuclear energy. If the star's iron&nbsp;core is massive enough then it will collapse&nbsp;and become a supernova. Supernova 1983k,&nbsp;as it is called, was arguably the brightest&nbsp;Type II supernova with a plateau-shaped&nbsp;light curve – one that shows a rapid rise, followed by a broad dome that changes into&nbsp;a slow and gradual rate of decline. It was&nbsp;also the first Type II supernova for which&nbsp;high-quality spectra were obtained before&nbsp;it reached maximum light.</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Virpi S. Niemela (Cerro Tololo InterAmerican Observatory) and his colleagues believe that Supernova 1983k's light curve&nbsp;is evidence that the progenitor star was&nbsp;an exploding Wolf-Rayet star or a red&nbsp;supergiant, which had an extensive, preexisting circumstellar shell. This suggestion was confirmed by E. Grasburg (RadioAstrophysical Observatory) who explains&nbsp;the supernova's light curve by the interaction of a shock with matter in the extended&nbsp;circumstellar shell produced by a previous&nbsp;ejection from a star that was 9–14 solar&nbsp;masses. Grasburg also determined the distance to the supernova to be about 80 million light-years distant, which is comparable to Tully's determination in the table&nbsp;above. The galaxy then has a linear diameter of 73,000 light-years with a total luminosity of 78 billion Suns. NGC 4699, by the&nbsp;way, was also host to another supernova –&nbsp;17th-magnitude Supernova 1948a – which&nbsp;appeared 46<span class="font2"><sup>^^</sup> </span><span class="font19">north of the galaxy's nucleus,&nbsp;so keep your eye on this galaxy for others.</span></p>

As I pressed my body&nbsp;against the wooden railing of this movable&nbsp;platform – the only object separating me&nbsp;from the telescope – I realized (with a dash&nbsp;of dizziness) just how precipitous observing&nbsp;conditions were in Rosse's day. One misstep&nbsp;would send the observer down a sheer drop&nbsp;of 60 feet into a deep and black abyss. It also&nbsp;occurred to me that, given the telescope's&nbsp;limited access to altitude and azimuth – and&nbsp;considering that the telescope faces south –&nbsp;to discover the spiral nature of M51, Lord&nbsp;Rosse had to be observing with the telescope near its maximum height – a very precipitous position indeed. His observation&nbsp;of NGC 4725's ring would have been much&nbsp;more relaxing. By the way, Lord Rosse not&nbsp;only noticed that NGC 4725 has an inner&nbsp;ring, but he also said that it was an “incomplete” oval.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Rosse was a man dedicated to discovery, the importance of which he outlined in part&nbsp;of his address given to the 1854 meeting of&nbsp;the British Association for the Advancement&nbsp;of Science: “The love of truth; the pleasure&nbsp;the mind feels in overcoming difficulties; the&nbsp;satisfaction of contributing to the general&nbsp;store of knowledge; the engrossing nature&nbsp;of a pursuit so exalted as that of diving into&nbsp;the wonders of creation; all these are very&nbsp;powerful incentives to exertion.”</p>

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">When I concentrate on NGC 5281 with low power,&nbsp;the first thing I notice is&nbsp;a bejeweled crescent of&nbsp;suns, oriented northeast–&nbsp;southwest consisting of stars&nbsp;of 8th magnitude and fainter.&nbsp;Two arms jut out from the&nbsp;northeast end, one to the&nbsp;north, one to the east. A&nbsp;fainter string of stars extends&nbsp;from the southwest end of&nbsp;the curve and gradually curls&nbsp;away to the west. With 72<span class="font5">×&nbsp;</span><span class="font19">and 101 </span><span class="font5">×</span><span class="font19">, the cluster looks&nbsp;like a little scorpion with&nbsp;claws and a raised tail.

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;">nuclei of faint, tail-less comets.” And that is just how NGC 5281 appears in my antique&nbsp;telescope.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Under dark skies, NGC 5281 is visible to the naked eye as a 6th-magnitude star, even&nbsp;when it is very low in the sky. The object&nbsp;appears swollen and ill defined in 7 <span class="font5">× </span><span class="font19">50&nbsp;binoculars – it does indeed look like the&nbsp;nuclear region of a tailless comet. Through&nbsp;the 4-inch at 23</span><span class="font5">×</span><span class="font19">, the cluster is a tiny package of light in the choppy seas of the Milky&nbsp;Way, which appears to be frothing haphazardly here and there with “windblown”&nbsp;clumps of dim starlight. What's interesting, because of its compactness, once I lock&nbsp;my eye onto NGC 5281, the cluster has&nbsp;the power to draw my attention away from&nbsp;everything else around it. It is as if I have&nbsp;found a floating treasure chest and want to&nbsp;do nothing else but use my telescope as a</span></p><div style="float:right;layout-flow:horizontal;"><img src="Hidden Treasures_files/Hidden Treasures-325.jpg" style="width:185pt;height:244pt;"/></div>

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">In larger telescopes, the main form of the cluster remains the same. For instance,&nbsp;when James Dunlop observed it from Paramatta, New South Wales in 1826 with a 9-inch f/12 telescope, he wrote, “This is a&nbsp;curved line of [faint] stars, about 1<span class="font17"><sub>2</sub><sup>1 </sup></span><span class="font2"><sup>^</sup> </span><span class="font19">long,&nbsp;with a star of the 7th mag in the north&nbsp;extremity; a group of extremely [faint] stars&nbsp;on the preceding side of the crescent, and&nbsp;a multitude of very [faint] stars extended&nbsp;preceding and following.” The only difference appears to be the sudden magnificence of the background Milky Way and&nbsp;the intensity of the stars' colors. As Ernst&nbsp;J. Hartung observed with his 12-inch reflector, NGC 5281 is a “beautiful scattered cluster of fairly bright stars merging into a fine&nbsp;field and concentrated at the centre in a pattern of two crossing curved lines of brighter&nbsp;stars, yellow, bluish, white and orange . . . on&nbsp;a clear dark night this is a most lovely field.”</span></p></td>

<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">The galaxy is classified as being either “irregular” or “peculiar” and has not been&nbsp;extensively studied. High-resolution images&nbsp;show the bright nucleus (and the superimposed star) with a narrow dust lane cutting across the major axis. Very Long Baseline Interferometry ( VLBI) observations (in&nbsp;which the data from individual telescopes at&nbsp;different locations are sent to a central correlator and the signals combined) also confirmed the dark cloud in front of the core,&nbsp;as well as its neutral hydrogen profile whose&nbsp;emission characteristics are like those from&nbsp;the disk of an early-type galaxy. Although it&nbsp;is uncertain, NGC 5363 could be a lenticular&nbsp;galaxy with an anomalously large amount&nbsp;of dust. R. Brent Tully lists the object's inclination as 38<span class="font2"><sup>◦</sup> </span><span class="font19">from edge-on.

I could detect only one&nbsp;star, of about 13th magnitude, on the southwest flank. But those using larger telescopes&nbsp;could confuse any one of these field stars&nbsp;with a supernova.</p>

As Joseph Winlock, the observatory's third director, said,&nbsp;“[Trouvelot] combined in rare degree the&nbsp;qualities of an excellent observer with the&nbsp;skill of an accomplished artist.” But Trou-velot also had an enterprising side to his&nbsp;character. And sometime between 1868–&nbsp;1869 he brought to North America some&nbsp;hardy silkworms to breed. Trouvelot wanted&nbsp;to develop a strain of silk moth that was&nbsp;resistant to disease as a part of an effort&nbsp;to begin a commercial silk industry. Alas,&nbsp;some of these insects escaped when a specimen jar fell from an open window at Trou-velot's home in Medford, Massachusetts.&nbsp;Later, more moths and caterpillars escaped&nbsp;from small populations growing on shrubs&nbsp;in Trouvelot's garden when high winds&nbsp;blew off protective netting. The artist notified townspeople about the accidents, but&nbsp;nobody thought the gypsy moth was a pest.&nbsp;<span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Wrong</span><span class="font19"> !</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">The insects soon multiplied in a vacant lot next to Trouvelot's home. They then began&nbsp;to travel. Today, despite all control efforts&nbsp;since its introduction, the gypsy moth has&nbsp;persisted and has extended its range across&nbsp;state lines. Now the gypsy moth is the most&nbsp;important insect pest of forest and shade&nbsp;trees in eastern USA.

<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">NGC 5746 is a massive edge-on system that belongs to the Virgo–Libra Cloud of&nbsp;Galaxies. It has a whopping linear diameter of 162,000 light-years and a total luminosity of 76 billion Suns. It is a shame that&nbsp;this object is often overlooked by amateurs&nbsp;since it is so easy to find. Larry Mitchell of&nbsp;Houston, Texas, says, “This object is one of&nbsp;my favorites and, yes, it is very much overlooked by amateurs. It is extremely easy to&nbsp;locate and does not require a star chart. It&nbsp;reminds me somewhat of a smaller version&nbsp;ofNGC 4565.” In fact, if you accept my visual&nbsp;magnitude estimate (9.3) of NGC 5746, it is&nbsp;just brighterthanNGC 4565 (Caldwell 38) in&nbsp;Coma Berenices and NGC 891 (Caldwell 23)&nbsp;in Andromeda. Yet our hidden treasure is&nbsp;at least three times more distant than both&nbsp;those wonders.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">NGC 5746 is an intermediate-type spiral with a very small, bright nucleus in a moderately small, though bright, peanut-shaped</p></td></tr></table><hr>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;">bulge. It is the brighter member of a non-physical&nbsp;pair with the normal spiral&nbsp;NGC5740.WeseeNGC5746's&nbsp;bulge just below the nearside dust lane as well as above&nbsp;it; for this to happen when&nbsp;the bulge is moderately small&nbsp;requires the line of sight to&nbsp;be within only a few degrees&nbsp;from exactly edge-on. A dark&nbsp;dust lane obscures most of&nbsp;the nucleus. One theory of&nbsp;peanut-shaped bulges is&nbsp;that they are bars seen endor side-on. Indeed, spectroscopic observations of&nbsp;NGC 5746 suggest the presence of a bar seen partially&nbsp;side-on. The spiral pattern of&nbsp;bright and dark arms in the&nbsp;disk is well defined (save for</p><div style="float:right;layout-flow:horizontal;"><img src="Hidden Treasures_files/Hidden Treasures-336.jpg" style="width:255pt;height:278pt;"/></div>

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;">the projection foreshortening). The arms appear regular and fairly smooth, although&nbsp;they have degree of clumpiness.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">The arms of edge-on spiral galaxies are difficult to trace due to the orientation, but&nbsp;we do get an excellent view of the overall&nbsp;thickness of the disk. In NGC 5746, we get&nbsp;a good example of the galaxy's thickness&nbsp;and the absorbing dust that is present. By&nbsp;measuring and plotting the rotation curves&nbsp;(blue vs. redshift) of these edge-on galaxies, at increasing distances from the center,&nbsp;we obtain strong evidence that many galaxies contain large amounts of unseen material, which has been called “Dark Matter.”&nbsp;In many galaxies, estimates of the amount&nbsp;of luminous and invisible matter show that&nbsp;the dark or invisible matter outweighs what&nbsp;we can see– sometimes by as much as a factor of ten.</p></td>
<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">NGC 5746 is similar in structure to NGC 5078 in Hydra, which is an interesting galaxy due to jets of gas that are being&nbsp;ejected from the disk. It is also similar to that&nbsp;of the Seyfert-like galaxy NGC 4699 (Hidden&nbsp;Treasure 68). And like NGC 4699, emission&nbsp;from the nucleus is very weak, which may&nbsp;be indicative of a large black hole that is&nbsp;currently not being fed with stellar mass. As&nbsp;GaryBower(UniversityofMichigan)andhis&nbsp;colleagues state in a 1993 <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Astrophysical Journal</span><span class="font19"> paper, they cannot rule out the presence&nbsp;of a 10-million-solar-mass black hole at the&nbsp;center of NGC 5746. Another possibility is&nbsp;that a starburst episode has recently mostly&nbsp;shut down.</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">To find NGC 5746, all you have to do is locate 109 Virginis, which is nearly&nbsp;18<span class="font2"><sup>◦</sup> </span><span class="font19">north and slightly west of Alpha (</span><span class="font5">^</span><span class="font19">)&nbsp;Librae (Zubenelgenubi) or a little more than&nbsp;13</span><span class="font2"><sup>◦</sup> </span><span class="font19">northwest of Beta (</span><span class="font5">^</span><span class="font19">) Librae (Zube-neschamali). What's odd, is that to measure&nbsp;the discovery position ofNGC 5746, William&nbsp;Herschel offset, not from 109 Virginis, but&nbsp;from 108 Virginis: “It precedes 108 Virg. of&nbsp;Flamsteed's Catalog by0 min. 35 sec. in time&nbsp;and is 1</span><span class="font2"><sup>◦</sup> </span><span class="font19">15</span><span class="font2"><sup>^</sup> </span><span class="font19">north of that star.”</span></p></td></tr></table><hr>

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">As with NGC 891 (Caldwell 23), NGC 4565 (Caldwell 38), and other edge-on systems,&nbsp;NGC 5746 has a low surface brightness. In&nbsp;the 4-inch at 23<span class="font5">×</span><span class="font19">, it all but fades from view&nbsp;with a direct glance, but just like the other&nbsp;edge-on galaxies, NGC 5746 swells into a&nbsp;fine sliver of light with averted vision; in&nbsp;fact, it is more apparent than NGC 891,&nbsp;appearing like a sharp needle with a bright&nbsp;bead balanced at the center like a pearl held&nbsp;steadily on a pirate's blade. With 72</span><span class="font5">× </span><span class="font19">and&nbsp;averted vision, the Seyfert nucleus is even&nbsp;more magnificent – a star in a thin wafer&nbsp;of light. The disk is not uniform, especially&nbsp;to the south, where there is a definite star or&nbsp;enhancement. With time I can also make out&nbsp;a waviness to the galaxy's bulge on the larger&nbsp;western side. Here is where light from the&nbsp;galaxy's disk, tilted ever so slightly toward&nbsp;our direction allows a glimpse of starlight&nbsp;populating the inner spiral.</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">In time, the dust lane is largely implied. The central pip is accompanied by two&nbsp;smaller (fainter) enhancements, which are&nbsp;probably tightly wound spiral structures&nbsp;seen nearly edge-on. At 101<span class="font5">×</span><span class="font19">, the galaxy&nbsp;remains visible but the contrast between it&nbsp;and the sky background diminishes greatly.&nbsp;Still, try studying the central lens at high&nbsp;power, to make out the finer details that waft&nbsp;in and out of view like luminous vapors.&nbsp;The dust lane is most prominent against&nbsp;the bulge and it is responsible for the waviness mentioned earlier. And the inner spiral enhancements look like bits of eye-</span></p></td>

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">NGC 5746 has two companions nearby. NGC 5740 is a little spiral almost 20<span class="font2"><sup>^</sup> </span><span class="font19">to the&nbsp;southwest; it shines at magnitude 11.9 and&nbsp;has a very bright nucleus.

The&nbsp;history surrounding this debate is worth&nbsp;repeating.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:9pt;padding:0pt 0pt 9pt 0pt;">In Messier's catalog, the 102nd entry is described as:</p>

<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">On April 13, 1781, Messier made the last observation of the objects included&nbsp;in his final supplement of the catalog.&nbsp;It was of M100, a “nebula without star”&nbsp;in Virgo, which Messier's contemporary,&nbsp;Pierre Mechain, had discovered the previ-ousmonth.Thesupplementappearedinthe&nbsp;French almanac <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Connaissance des Temps</span><span class="font19"> for&nbsp;1784, which would be published in 1781.&nbsp;Mechain had supplied Messier with a number of new objects, and though Messier&nbsp;worked feverishly to observe all of them&nbsp;before his publishing deadline, time ran out&nbsp;and three objects went unseen. Still, Messier&nbsp;appended these objects as numbers 101,&nbsp;102, and 103 to the supplement under the&nbsp;heading: “By M. Mechain, which M. Messier&nbsp;</span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">has not yet seen,</span><span class="font19">” [emphasis mine]. Furthermore, Mechain had provided Messier&nbsp;with a measured position for only the 101st&nbsp;entry.</span></p></td></tr></table><hr>

<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:9pt;padding:0pt 0pt 10pt 0pt;">After the supplement was printed, Mechain noticed an error – entry 102 was&nbsp;not a new object, but rather a second&nbsp;observation of entry 101. After discussing&nbsp;the matter with Messier, Mechain drafted&nbsp;a letter of correction, which first appeared,&nbsp;in abbreviated form, in the <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Histoire</span><span class="font19"> of the&nbsp;Berlin Academy for 1782. A copy of the&nbsp;letter (dated May 6, 1783), was also sent to&nbsp;Johann Bernoulli in Berlin, who was editor&nbsp;of the </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Berliner Astronomisches Jahrbuch.&nbsp;</span><span class="font19">Bernoulli translated the original letter into&nbsp;German and printed it in 1786:</span></p>
<p class="font18" style="text-align:justify;padding:0pt 0pt 10pt 9pt;">On page 267 of the <span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">Connaissance des Temps</span><span class="font18"> for 1784 M. Messier lists under No. 102 a nebula&nbsp;whichIhavediscoveredbetweenomicronBoo-tis and iota Draconis. This is nothing but an&nbsp;error. This nebula is the same as the preceding&nbsp;No. 101. In the list of my nebulous stars communicated to him M. Messier was confused&nbsp;due to an error in the sky-chart.</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;padding:0pt 0pt 10pt 0pt;">Clearly, Mechain wasted little time in trying to undo the mistake. And his words solve the&nbsp;mystery “with complete certainty,” according to Harvardhistorian Owen Gingerich. In&nbsp;his contribution to <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">The Messier Album</span><span class="font19"> (Sky&nbsp;Publishing, 1978), Gingerich writes:</span></p>
<p class="font18" style="text-align:justify;padding:0pt 0pt 6pt 9pt;">In 1877 [Edwin] Holden included a reference to Mechain's letter in his useful <span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">Index Catalogue of Books and Memoirs Relating to Nebulae and Clusters</span><span class="font18">.

<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;padding:0pt 0pt 11pt 0pt;">Mystery solved? So it would seem. Yet despite these facts, many observers refuse&nbsp;to accept that M102 is a duplication of&nbsp;M101. They cling to the belief that M102 is&nbsp;a separate object. Such passion, however, is&nbsp;unfounded.</p>
<p class="font5" style="text-align:justify;">MURKY WATERS</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;">The story of M102 can be briefly told: Mechain communicates to Messier a list of&nbsp;new objects. Messier confirms all but three&nbsp;of them before he submits his work for publication. In haste, Messier appends the three&nbsp;unconfirmed objects to his work and introduces an error. Mechain notices the mistake&nbsp;and publishes a letter of correction.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:9pt;">There is nothing mysterious about the story. It is well documented. The mystery&nbsp;stems from a popular theory based on a&nbsp;single assumption. The problem is that the&nbsp;theory introduces more mysteries than it&nbsp;attempts to solve. But before we look at that&nbsp;theory more closely, let me restate one very&nbsp;important fact: Messier never observed, nor&nbsp;did he attempt to observe, the 101st and&nbsp;102nd objects in his supplement before it&nbsp;went to print. So there is no need to try to&nbsp;imagine what objects Messier might have&nbsp;seen in the area. The only person who saw&nbsp;anything was Mechain.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:9pt;padding:0pt 0pt 3pt 0pt;">At the heart of the M102 theory is the error on Messier's sky chart. Many have&nbsp;speculated on this error and have come to&nbsp;the same conclusion, which was first introduced by William Henry Smyth in his 1844&nbsp;<span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">A Cycle of Celestial Objects.</span><span class="font19"> It can be found&nbsp;in his discussion of M102:</span></p></td></tr></table><hr><div style="float:left;layout-flow:horizontal;"><img src="Hidden Treasures_files/Hidden Treasures-340.jpg" style="width:255pt;height:213pt;"/></div>

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:9pt;padding:0pt 0pt 0pt 8pt;">Smyth's solution is beautiful except for one fact: if Mechain had discovered&nbsp;NGC 5866, he was not aware&nbsp;of it. In the letter he sent to&nbsp;Bernoulli – the same one in&nbsp;which he corrects the error&nbsp;concerning M102 – Mechain&nbsp;included the descriptions of&nbsp;six nebulae he discovered in&nbsp;1781, and NGC 5866 is not&nbsp;among them.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:9pt;padding:0pt 0pt 0pt 8pt;">But mistaking Theta Bootis for Omicron Bootis, as Smyth suggests, can't be</p>

There may be a&nbsp;doubt as to whether this is the nebula discovered by Mechain in 1781, since Messier&nbsp;merely describes it as “very faint,” and situated between o Bootis and <span class="font4">^ </span><span class="font18">Draconis. But there&nbsp;must be some mistake here; the one being on&nbsp;the herdsman's leg, and the other in the coil of&nbsp;the Dragon far above the head of Bootes, having 22</span><span class="font1"><sup>◦</sup> </span><span class="font18">of declination and 44</span><span class="font1"><sup>^</sup> </span><span class="font18">of time between&nbsp;them, a space full of all descriptions of celestial&nbsp;objects.

<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;">In addition to being the first to suggest that Messier confused the star Theta Bootis for Omicron Bootis, Smyth appears to be&nbsp;the first to suggest that M102 is NGC 5866&nbsp;(which John Herschel listed as object 1909&nbsp;[h 1909] in his catalog; Smyth confuses the&nbsp;issue by misidentifying this same object as&nbsp;the only error, since M101 does not lie&nbsp;between Theta Bootis and Omicron Draconis. If Mechain had discovered a nebula&nbsp;between these stars, wouldn't he have told&nbsp;Bernoulli?Asthe late <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Sky &amp; Telescope</span><span class="font19"> columnist Walter Scott Houston once quipped&nbsp;about Smyth's identification of M102, “one&nbsp;wrong assumption coupled with immaculate logic produced a can of worms.”</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Some have argued that Mechain's descriptions of M101 and M102 are suspiciously different, since he calls M101&nbsp;a “nebula without star, very obscure and&nbsp;large” and M102 a “very faint” nebula&nbsp;near a “star of the 6th magnitude.” The&nbsp;difference between a very obscure nebula&nbsp;and a veryfaintnebulais trivial.M101is two&nbsp;magnitudes brighter than NGC 5866.

<p class="font5" style="text-align:justify;">SO WHAT IS M102?</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;">Is there a way to use known facts to solve the mystery of M102? Yes. All we have to&nbsp;do is accept Mechain's words – there was&nbsp;an error on Messier's star chart; Messier was&nbsp;confused; and M102 is a second observation&nbsp;of M101.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:9pt;padding:0pt 0pt 9pt 0pt;">Here is how Messier presented Mechain's description of M101 in the 1784 <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Connais-sance des Temps</span><span class="font19"> :</span></p>
<p class="font18" style="text-align:justify;padding:0pt 0pt 9pt 9pt;">Nebula without a star, very obscure and extremely large, 6 to 7 minutes in diameter,&nbsp;between the left hand of Bootes and the tail&nbsp;of Ursa Major. Difficult to distinguish when the&nbsp;crosshairs are illuminated.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;">Messieralsoincludedapositiondetermined by Mechain on March 27, 1781, that is quite&nbsp;accurate in declination but about 1 <span class="font17"><sub>4</sub><sup>3 </sup></span><span class="font2"><sup>◦</sup> </span><span class="font19">west&nbsp;of its true position. As reported on the&nbsp;Students For Exploration of Space website&nbsp;(</span><a href="http://www.seds.org/messier/m/m102d"><span class="font19">http://www.seds.org/messier/m/m102d</span></a><span class="font19">.&nbsp;html) – where, by the way, you will find&nbsp;an interesting opposing view to my argument – in his personal copy of the catalog&nbsp;printed in the </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Connaissance des Temps&nbsp;</span><span class="font19">for 1784, Messier penned a position for&nbsp;M102 that falls almost midway between&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">^ </span><span class="font19">Bootis and </span><span class="font5">^ </span><span class="font19">Draconis. Just as Mechain&nbsp;had stated in his letter to Bernoulli, there&nbsp;was an error on Messier's star chart.&nbsp;Either </span><span class="font5">^ </span><span class="font19">Bootis was mislabeled o Bootis&nbsp;or, in his haste, Messier simply mistook </span><span class="font5">^&nbsp;</span><span class="font19">for o.</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:9pt;padding:0pt 0pt 4pt 0pt;">Unfortunately this discovery does not solve the mystery of M102, because nothing exists at the penned position. The closest object is the 12th-magnitude galaxy&nbsp;NGC 5687, which was too faint for Mechain&nbsp;to see. NGC 5866 is 3<span class="font2"><sup>◦</sup> </span><span class="font19">east-northeast of the&nbsp;penned position, and M101, on the other&nbsp;hand, is more than 6</span><span class="font2"><sup>◦</sup> </span><span class="font19">west of it.</span></p></td>
<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">If M102 is indeed M101, and if <span class="font5">^ </span><span class="font19">Bootis was mislabeled on Messier's star chart (which&nbsp;makes perfect sense because </span><span class="font5">^ </span><span class="font19">is in the “left&nbsp;hand of Bootes”), then the only thing that&nbsp;does not make sense is the position of M102&nbsp;that Messier penned in his personal copy of&nbsp;the </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Connaissance des Temps.</span><span class="font19"> Did Mechain&nbsp;mean that Messier was confused because he&nbsp;went in the wrong direction when he plotted&nbsp;Mechain's second observation?</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Since <span class="font5">^ </span><span class="font19">Bootis is the brightest naked-eye star near M101, Messier likely would have&nbsp;used it as an offset star. Indeed, note that&nbsp;Messier does use “the left hand of Bootis&nbsp;[</span><span class="font5">^ </span><span class="font19">Bootis]” to help position M101. So I plotted Messier's penned position of M102 on&nbsp;a star atlas and stepped back to study the&nbsp;scene. I was immediately struck by how well&nbsp;this position mirrored M101's position with&nbsp;respect to </span><span class="font5">^</span><span class="font19">. If Messier's penned position of&nbsp;M102 is plotted west of </span><span class="font5">^ </span><span class="font19">Bootis instead of&nbsp;east of the star, then it falls almost right on&nbsp;top of the modern position of M101.</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Finally, is there any physical evidence that two positions of M101 actually exist? Yes,&nbsp;and these positions have been in our hands,&nbsp;or at least many bookshelves, for decades.&nbsp;<span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Sky &amp; Telescope</span><span class="font19"> magazine senior editor Dennis di Cicco noticed that in </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">The Messier&nbsp;Album</span><span class="font19"> (Sky Publishing, 1978), in the facsimile of the Messier catalog (as Messier&nbsp;himself published in the </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Connaissance des&nbsp;Temps</span><span class="font19">), there are two right-ascension positions for each object – one in time, the&nbsp;other in degrees, minutes, and seconds.&nbsp;Unlike all the other objects, the two posi-tionsgivenforM101differfromoneanother.&nbsp;The 1781 position of M101 in time, when&nbsp;precessed to epoch 2000.0, is right ascension 13</span><span class="font17"><sup>h</sup> </span><span class="font19">51</span><span class="font17"><sup>m</sup> </span><span class="font19">33</span><span class="font17"><sup>s</sup></span><span class="font19">; declination </span><span class="font5">+</span><span class="font19">54</span><span class="font2"><sup>◦</sup> </span><span class="font19">19</span><span class="font2"><sup>^</sup> </span><span class="font19">09</span><span class="font2"><sup>^^</sup></span><span class="font19">.&nbsp;That position places M101 1 </span><span class="font17"><sup>3</sup><sub>4</sub> </span><span class="font2"><sup>◦</sup> </span><span class="font19">to the west&nbsp;of M101's modern position.

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">In summary, if you accept my argument, M102 is simply a second, more refined,&nbsp;observation of M101. There is no reason,&nbsp;then, to be suspicious of Mechain's letter&nbsp;to Bernoulli; Mechain and Messier did not&nbsp;conspire to hide the truth – unless you also&nbsp;want to believe that Mechain and Messier&nbsp;were members of the Illuminati and M102's&nbsp;erroneous position is a clue to help its members locate the Holy Grail. No, Mechain's letter is full of truths. And while the theories&nbsp;that Smyth and others have put forth over&nbsp;the years have certainly been enticing, if not&nbsp;entertaining, close inspection renders them&nbsp;unlikely.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">If you accept my argument, the mystery concerning NGC 5866 is over and the principle of simplicity has prevailed. Of course,&nbsp;that does not mean you shouldn't look at&nbsp;this marvelous object, which, undeniably,&nbsp;was discovered on May 5, 1788, by William&nbsp;Herschel. On the contrary, NGC 5866 is a&nbsp;remarkable object, especially through the&nbsp;high-quality telescopes so commonly used&nbsp;by amateurs today. We can see the object in&nbsp;ways that Messier and Mechain could only&nbsp;imagine. And that is why I have made it a&nbsp;hidden treasure.</p></td>
<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font5" style="text-align:justify;">THE MODERN VIEW</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;">NGC 5866 is a remarkable nearly edge-on object (90,000 light-years in diameter) with a very bright ring and a dust lane –&nbsp;both of which are tilted against the equatorial plane of the elliptical halo – and contains an extended halo of globular clusters.&nbsp;Indeed, the outer envelope simulates an&nbsp;elliptical galaxy (which is generally known to&nbsp;be globular-cluster rich), but the lens shows&nbsp;a narrow ring of dark material surrounding&nbsp;the large nucleus. So it has a classic lenticular form.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">The galaxy has an unusually rapid gas rotation curve with a measured maximum&nbsp;rate of 320 kilometers per second within&nbsp;about3,000light-yearsofthegalacticcenter.&nbsp;This is much faster than would be expected&nbsp;based upon the light distribution of the&nbsp;bulge and the disk, and two possibilities&nbsp;have been proposed. One is that there is&nbsp;an unaccounted mass component found&nbsp;within the disk and the other possibility is&nbsp;a decoupled system located at the galactic&nbsp;center which is the result of a past capture&nbsp;or merging process.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">NGC 5866 is also remarkable for being immersed in a massive molecular cloud.&nbsp;NGC 5866 has two wide companions (NGC&nbsp;5907 and NGC 5879): NGC 5907 is a&nbsp;thin 10th-magnitude ellipse about 1 <span class="font17"><sub>2</sub><sup>1 </sup></span><span class="font2"><sup>◦</sup> </span><span class="font19">to&nbsp;the northeast, and NGC 5879 is an 11th-magnitude ellipse about 1 </span><span class="font17"><sup>1</sup><sub>4</sub> </span><span class="font2"><sup>◦</sup> </span><span class="font19">to the northnortheast. All three galaxies have very similar redshifts which suggests the galaxies&nbsp;formawidephysicalgroup. They are located&nbsp;at approximately half the distance from&nbsp;each other that the Milky Way and M31&nbsp;are, so hypothetical backyard observers living on a planet within the disk of any&nbsp;one of these three galaxies certainly would&nbsp;have two stunning naked-eye extragalactic</span></p></td></tr></table><hr>

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Otherwise, NGC 5866 is relatively isolated, and there&nbsp;appears to be no evidence&nbsp;for any tidal distortions. So&nbsp;the existence of such a large&nbsp;gas shell, which is bright in&nbsp;infrared light, indicates that&nbsp;NGC 5866 may be entering an era of star formation fueled with gas donated&nbsp;by its aging stellar population. G. K. Kacprzak (New&nbsp;Mexico State University) and&nbsp;G. A. Welch (Saint Mary's&nbsp;University) presented evidence to support this contention at a 2003 American&nbsp;Astronomical Society meeting. After analyzing the dust&nbsp;and gas components of the</p><div style="float:right;layout-flow:horizontal;"><img src="Hidden Treasures_files/Hidden Treasures-341.jpg" style="width:255pt;height:277pt;"/></div>

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;">ngc 5897 is an unusually loosely structured globular cluster that haunts the&nbsp;dim and unassuming stars of Libra. William&nbsp;Herschel found the cluster on March 10,&nbsp;1785, and logged it as the 19th object in his&nbsp;Class VI category of objects. It is possible&nbsp;that he observed it earlier, on April 25,&nbsp;1784, when he logged his H VI-8 with an&nbsp;inaccurate position. He considered it an&nbsp;important discovery because, in his view, it&nbsp;was “one of the gradations from palpable&nbsp;congeries of stars . . . towards the distant&nbsp;nebulae.” In his explorations of the nebulae, Herschel tried to connect the visual&nbsp;appearance of clusters and nebulae with&nbsp;some sort of physical reality. He believed&nbsp;that individual stars were closer to us than&nbsp;the nebulae. He believed that all nebulae&nbsp;were universes in the process of formation&nbsp;but seen at different distances. He believed&nbsp;that a nebula's degree of concentration was&nbsp;directly related to its state of evolution –&nbsp;highly evolved systems had high degrees&nbsp;of concentration and vice versa. NGC 5897&nbsp;was a system that was intermediate in&nbsp;distance and in evolution.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:9pt;padding:0pt 0pt 6pt 0pt;">Writingofthisdiscoveryinthe<span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Philosoph-ical Transactions</span><span class="font19"> Herschel says:</span></p>
<p class="font18" style="text-align:justify;padding:0pt 0pt 13pt 9pt;">When I pursued these researches, I was in the situation of a natural philosopher who follows&nbsp;the various species of animals and insects from&nbsp;the height of their perfection down to the lowest ebb of life . . . In the same manner we pass&nbsp;through gentle steps from a coarse cluster of&nbsp;stars, such as the Pleiades, the Praesepe, the&nbsp;Milky Way, the cluster in the Crab, the nebula in&nbsp;Hercules,that near thepreceding hipof Bootes,&nbsp;&amp;c. &amp;c, without any hesitation, till we find ourselves brought to such an object as the nebula&nbsp;in Orion, where we are still inclined to remain&nbsp;in the once adopted idea, of stars exceedingly&nbsp;remote and inconceivably crowded, as being&nbsp;the occasion of that remarkable appearance.&nbsp;It seems, therefore, to require a more dissimilar object to set us right again. A glance like&nbsp;that of the naturalist, who casts his eye from&nbsp;the perfect animal to the perfect vegetable, is&nbsp;wanting to remove the veil from the mind of&nbsp;theastronomer.TheobjectIhave&nbsp;mentioned above [NGC 5897], is&nbsp;the phenomenon that was wanting for this purpose. View, for&nbsp;instance, this cluster, and afterwards cast your eye on that&nbsp;cloudy star, and the result will&nbsp;be no less decisive than that of&nbsp;the naturalist we have alluded to.&nbsp;Our judgment, I may venture to&nbsp;say, will be, that <span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">the nebulosity&nbsp;about the star is not of a starry&nbsp;nature.</span></p></td>
<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;">Herschel went on to call the cluster a “wondrous but difficult object.” Admiral William&nbsp;Henry Smyth called it a&nbsp;“large compressed cluster of&nbsp;minute stars,” saying “it is&nbsp;faint and pale, but owing&nbsp;to the fineness of the night,&nbsp;steadiness of gaze, and excellent action of&nbsp;the telescope, [it] was as well seen as so low&nbsp;and so awfully remote an object could be&nbsp;expected to be.” In modern times, and seen&nbsp;from the Southern Hemisphere, Ernst Hartung simply calls it “irregularly round” and&nbsp;“conspicuous.”</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">The cluster can be seen on clear, moonless nights as a large amorphous glow nearly one-third the apparent size of Omega&nbsp;(<span class="font5">^</span><span class="font19">) Centauri (Caldwell 80).

If you&nbsp;cannot see the star with your naked eye, use&nbsp;binoculars to locate it, then aim your finder&nbsp;at that location. There will be no mistaking Iota for two reasons: (1) it is the only&nbsp;star of that magnitude in the region; (2) 6th-magnitude 25 Lib lies only about 17</span><span class="font2"><sup>^</sup> </span><span class="font19">to the&nbsp;northeast, so you will see a fine pair of bright&nbsp;stars in your binoculars or telescope.

The brightest&nbsp;stars in the halo extend outward in weak and&nbsp;wavy arms, and with imagination look like&nbsp;wilting flower petals. An arc of foreground&nbsp;stars (magnitudes 11 to 13) illuminate the&nbsp;cluster's northeast border. If I were William&nbsp;Herschel, I would see four tiers of stars. The&nbsp;bright arc of stars would be closest. The&nbsp;cluster's hourglass shaped core would be on&nbsp;the next tier, followed by the sprinkling of&nbsp;dimmer suns in the halo, and finally the&nbsp;luminous “ether” in the background.</span></p></td></tr></table><hr>

Yet, while&nbsp;NGC 5897 and NGC 288 are both loose clusters with significant blue straggler populations, the two clusters differ greatly in metal-licity.

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;">During his prodigious career, Wilhelm Struve (1793–1864) – the first of&nbsp;seven Struves in five generations to obtain a&nbsp;Ph.D. (or its equivalent) in astronomy, and&nbsp;the director of Dorpat and later of Pulkovo&nbsp;Observatory – was one of the greatest&nbsp;astronomers of all time. Among his many&nbsp;accomplishments, he founded Pulkovo&nbsp;Observatory and made fundamental contributions in studies of double stars, stellar&nbsp;parallax, galactic structure, astrometry, and&nbsp;geodessy. It was while he was searching&nbsp;for double stars between 1824–1826 with&nbsp;the Dorpat 9.6 f/17.8 Fraunhofer refractor&nbsp;that Struve discovered seven <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">NGC</span><span class="font19"> objects.&nbsp;Prime among them is NGC 6210, a brilliant&nbsp;planetary in Hercules and our hidden&nbsp;treasure; it was the fifth object listed in the&nbsp;appendix of his 1827 </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Catalogus novus gen-eralis stellarum duplicium et multiplicium</span><span class="font19">.&nbsp;The other six </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">NGC</span><span class="font19"> objects are as follows:&nbsp;NGC 629, an asterism in Cassiopeia; NGC&nbsp;6572 (Hidden Treasure 90), a planetary nebula in Ophiuchus; NGC 6648, a double star&nbsp;in Draco; NGC 2202, a double star in Orion;&nbsp;NGC 6871, an open cluster in Cygnus; and&nbsp;NGC 6873, an asterism in Sagitta.</span></p></td>

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Professional astronomers have not shied away from this Herculean gem, and it has&nbsp;been the subject of many studies. Descriptions of the planetary's spectrum date to&nbsp;Royal Observatory director Richard Hugh&nbsp;Stoy's pioneering work in 1935, while the&nbsp;intensities of the principal lines were first&nbsp;measured by Lawrence Aller (University&nbsp;of California, Los Angeles) in 1941. Early&nbsp;photographic images show an amorphous&nbsp;shape with a concentration of light toward&nbsp;the center. And a comparison of calibrated spectroscopic plates taken between&nbsp;1938 and 1970 showed no obvious intensity changes. Likewise, O. C. Wilson's radial&nbsp;velocity measurements in 1950 indicated&nbsp;nothing unusual about the object's internal motions. In a 1970 study, Aller notes&nbsp;that he and his colleagues could not detect&nbsp;any obvious small-scale knots or blobs.&nbsp;The central star, however, did show a relatively high-excitation spectrum; its temperature being probably near 60,000 K. Aller&nbsp;and his colleagues regarded the nebula as&nbsp;“smooth.”</p></td>

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;padding:0pt 0pt 34pt 0pt;">By the mid 1990s, technological changes allowed astronomers better resolution in&nbsp;spectral imaging. In a 1996 <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Astronomical Journal</span><span class="font19"> paper, for instance, Spanish&nbsp;astronomer J. P. Phillips and L. Cuestra&nbsp;(Astrophysical Institute of the Canaries)&nbsp;acquired low- and intermediate-resolution&nbsp;spectroscopy at 11 positions across the&nbsp;nucleus of NGC 6210, which enabled them&nbsp;to map variations in velocity, temperature,&nbsp;line excitation, and density over the object's&nbsp;core and halo. They discovered that temperatures reach a peak value of aboout 11,000&nbsp;K close to the nucleus and decline by 24&nbsp;percent toward the periphery of the core,&nbsp;some 7.5</span><span class="font2"><sup>^^</sup> </span><span class="font19">from the 13th-magnitude central star. The nebula shows a greater degree&nbsp;of variation in its density, being 70 percent&nbsp;denser toward the north than the south,&nbsp;with smaller variations elsewhere across&nbsp;its face. Indeed, long-exposure images of&nbsp;NGC 6210 reveal a circular halo 65</span><span class="font2"><sup>^^</sup> </span><span class="font19">in diameter, containing two pairs of armlike extensions on opposing sides of the nucleus. All&nbsp;these properties lead the investigators to&nbsp;believe that NGC 6210's nucleus, in fact, may&nbsp;be ejecting material along two, and possibly four, opposing directions, the shock of&nbsp;which interacts with the ionized shells of&nbsp;gas, creating all manner of complex details.&nbsp;The jet also diffuses and curves the farther</span></p><img src="Hidden Treasures_files/Hidden Treasures-353.jpg" style="width:185pt;height:185pt;"/></td></tr></table><hr><div style="float:left;layout-flow:horizontal;"><img src="Hidden Treasures_files/Hidden Treasures-354.jpg" style="width:256pt;height:268pt;"/></div>

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">The tide of public attention suddenly turned to NGC 6210 when the Hubble Space&nbsp;Telescope published its titillating image of it&nbsp;(seen above). While we have become accustomed to seeing planety nebulae in many&nbsp;fantastic shapes and forms – hourglass, butterfly, stingray, spheres, and eyes – the HST&nbsp;image of NGC 6210 added “another bizarre&nbsp;form to the rogues' gallery of planetary&nbsp;nebulae: a turtle swallowing a seashell.”&nbsp;Indeed, as seen in hydrogen-alpha light,&nbsp;the bright inner shell of gas has a boxy,&nbsp;turtle-shell shape. Seen together with its&nbsp;four, flipper-like arms, the nebula does&nbsp;indeed resemble a turtle. The injested&nbsp;51 Herculis; it marks the west end of a&nbsp;2 <span class="font17"><sub>2</sub><sup>1 </sup></span><span class="font2"><sup>◦</sup></span><span class="font19">-wide diamond (oriented east–west) of&nbsp;slightly dimmer suns.

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Once again, the more time I spend with this very high-surface-brightness object,&nbsp;at 72 <span class="font5">× </span><span class="font19">the more detail I see. There is a&nbsp;bright core wrapped in some very tight&nbsp;layers of haze. I also get the impression&nbsp;of a diffuse outer halo. Through a 5 </span><span class="font17"><sup>1</sup><sub>2</sub> </span><span class="font19">-inch telescope, Webb, too, says that he&nbsp;saw a glow around the out-of-focus-starlike&nbsp;core.

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">At high powers, it is a complex mix of knots, rings, and other amorphous shapes.&nbsp;So, my impression is a complex nebula with&nbsp;two ellipses perpendicular to one another,&nbsp;like two galaxies colliding – with one passing&nbsp;through the nucleus of the other. I get that&nbsp;impression with all manner of high powers.&nbsp;Another impression I cannot shake is that of&nbsp;a “drawing compass” of knots, with the focus&nbsp;being to thenortheast; two other knots – one&nbsp;on either side of the “compass” at the ansae&nbsp;of the most elliptical parts of the annulus (to the northwest and southeast) complete this knot complex. I have to wonder&nbsp;if this complex is what Italian astronomer&nbsp;Angelo Secchi (1818–1878) observed when&nbsp;he thought he resolved the nebula with a&nbsp;power of 1,500<span class="font5">×</span><span class="font19">. The central complex of&nbsp;knots can be easily confused as a central star&nbsp;at low powers. The central star of the nebula is supposed to be magnitude 13.7 with&nbsp;possible variability.Anyway, that's about the&nbsp;brightness of the central star in M57, the&nbsp;Ring Nebula, which is difficult to see in a&nbsp;wide open annulus. There is no hope of seeing it in a 4-inch because the core or inner&nbsp;ring is too tight.</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Smyth notes that “there are four stars in the field, of which that in the [southeast]&nbsp;quadrant is of the 6th magnitude and&nbsp;brightly reddish, affording a fair test of&nbsp;comparison with the pale blue nebula.” He&nbsp;also notes that “it presents a visible disc&nbsp;of 8<span class="font2"><sup>^^</sup> </span><span class="font19">in diameter, at a distance probably&nbsp;equal to that of the star near it, the vastness of its dimensions is within the range&nbsp;of reasonable conjecture, however it may&nbsp;stagger the comprehension.” You have to&nbsp;love it when our astronomical forefathers&nbsp;triedtousetheirmindstopenetratethetwo-dimensional sky and plumb the depths of&nbsp;space with their imaginations. That in itself&nbsp;staggers the comprehension.</span></p></td></tr></table><hr><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"><img src="Hidden Treasures_files/Hidden Treasures-356.jpg" style="width:351pt;height:320pt;"/></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;">

David Malin of&nbsp;the AngloAustralianObservatory, notes that&nbsp;despite the foreground dust, astronomers&nbsp;have been able to estimate the age of the&nbsp;cluster by measuring the color and relative&nbsp;brightness of its stars. “The age turns out&nbsp;to be about 50 million years,” Malin says,&nbsp;“which is quite mature for an open cluster&nbsp;of this type.

But if you want to find NGC 6369, you&nbsp;have more than a ghost of a chance. First,&nbsp;locate Theta Ophiuchi. A little more than 1<span class="font2"><sup>◦&nbsp;</sup></span><span class="font19">to its northeast is 4th-magnitude 44 Ophiuchi.

But there is&nbsp;no mistaking its small form in the 4-inch&nbsp;at 23</span><span class="font5">×</span><span class="font19">. The nebula is projected against the&nbsp;blackness of B77, so, as its name implies,&nbsp;it appears like a translucent spirit materializing in the darkness. With any moderate&nbsp;magnification, the nebula is a perfect opal –&nbsp;smooth, round, and, well, opalescent. It is,&nbsp;as far as I can tell, one of the most perfect spheres imaginable in a small telescope.&nbsp;It gives me the pleasure of being able to&nbsp;see such a wonder and to imagine that I&nbsp;am truly seeing the disk of some gaseous&nbsp;body at a considerable distance. It brings to&nbsp;mind images of how William Herschel must&nbsp;have felt when he found the planet Uranus&nbsp;and then, later, these nebulous objects&nbsp;that mimicked so wonderfully that world's&nbsp;appearance.</span></p></td></tr></table><hr>

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">What I find remarkable is that Herschel failed to notice the object's annularity,&nbsp;which is a perfect smoke ring about the&nbsp;apparent diameter of Mars at a perihelic&nbsp;opposition; the nebula's dim and imperceptible outer envelope (at least in small telescopes) doubles the object's size. Luginbuhl&nbsp;and Skiff note that the annulus is clearly visible in a 6-inch telescope and measured the&nbsp;central hole at about 10<span class="font2"><sup>^^</sup> </span><span class="font19">in diameter. Perhaps Herschel's mind was on other things&nbsp;as he swept up this beautiful object. The&nbsp;ring didn't escape his son John's notice, who&nbsp;described it as an “annular nebula. Exactly&nbsp;round . . . well-terminated, but a very little&nbsp;cottony at the edge, and with a decided darkness in the middle . . . a beautiful specimen&nbsp;of the planetary annular class of nebulae.”</span></p></td>

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Curiously, and of note, Ernst J. Hartung says that the “darker centre can just be made&nbsp;out with [an 8-inch].” I write “curiously,”&nbsp;because in my 4-inch under significant&nbsp;magnification, the high-surface-brightness&nbsp;ring is obvious. Perhaps seeing the ring&nbsp;is a function of magnification and atmospheric seeing. In the 4-inch at 303<span class="font5">× </span><span class="font19">(under&nbsp;goodobservationconditions),theringhas a&nbsp;sharp interior that gradually dims outward.&nbsp;It's a stunning annulus that appears </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">ever so&nbsp;slightly</span><span class="font19"> out of round with averted vision;&nbsp;the major axis being oriented northeast–&nbsp;southwest. After studying the nebula with&nbsp;various magnifications, I noted some variations in intensity along the annulus, namely,&nbsp;at the southwest ansa and along the north-westernrim.Interestingly,ifyoulookclosely&nbsp;at the HST image, the ring's northwest rim&nbsp;does indeed appear brighter.</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">As you peer into this nebulous wonder, imagine that it offers us a glimpse ofour Sun&nbsp;some five billion years into the future, when&nbsp;it too will become a Little Ghost Nebula –&nbsp;one that will engulf the Earth and expand&nbsp;well beyond the orbit of Pluto. But that will&nbsp;not matter to us humans. We will be long&nbsp;gone; not as a race but as inhabitants of&nbsp;this Earth. By the time our Sun sheds its&nbsp;outer garments, we will have colonized new&nbsp;worlds. And with our telescopes set up in&nbsp;our new backyards, we will have front-row&nbsp;seats to an awesome spectacle: the dying&nbsp;gasps of our former Sun as it ends its life in&nbsp;the grandeur and glory that constitute the&nbsp;actions of a planetary nebula.

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;">ngc 6400 is not a bright cluster, but it is one that certainly caught my eye.&nbsp;One night, while attending the May 1994&nbsp;Texas Star Party, I swept the heavens for&nbsp;comets with a pair of 6-inch binoculars&nbsp;owned by Houston Astronomical Society&nbsp;member Larry Mitchell. As time passed,&nbsp;and my mind started to wander, my eyes&nbsp;suddenly focused on a most curious 8th-magnitude glow, round at first, then slightly&nbsp;elongated, as if it had a tail. My heart fluttered for a moment as the thought of a new&nbsp;comet knocked on the door of my mind. I&nbsp;paused to check with my naked eyes, just&nbsp;where I had been sweeping, which turned&nbsp;out to be immediately east of the Scorpion's&nbsp;Stinger stars – Lambda (<span class="font5">^</span><span class="font19">) and Upsilon (</span><span class="font5">^ </span><span class="font19">)&nbsp;Scorpii. I could not recall ever having seen&nbsp;a deep-sky object in this present position.&nbsp;Then again, I was under dark skies using&nbsp;giant binoculars (how everything looked so&nbsp;different with binocular vision). Without&nbsp;wasting another moment, I grabbed the&nbsp;second edition of Tirion's </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Sky Atlas 2000.0.&nbsp;</span><span class="font19">Now my heart pounded when I saw nothing&nbsp;plotted at that position. I just had to see the&nbsp;object with more power, to confirm it was&nbsp;truly cometary in nature and not some rich&nbsp;patch of the Milky Way. Larry had a 4-inch&nbsp;Tele Vue Genesis set up nearby, so I used it&nbsp;to sweep up this new object as I would from&nbsp;home. But the honeymoon didn't last. With&nbsp;one glance, I knew my “comet” was “just a&nbsp;cluster of ‘little' stars.”</span></p></td>
<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">The object turned out to be open cluster NGC 6400, which is plotted in the first edition of <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Sky Atlas 2000.0</span><span class="font19">, but not in&nbsp;the second.

The&nbsp;other reason is that I think&nbsp;it's a subtle but attractive&nbsp;sight. This particular cluster&nbsp;“speaks” to me like a lost&nbsp;puppy.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">James Dunlop must have been equally curious when&nbsp;he discovered the object with&nbsp;his 9-inch telescope at Paramatta, New South Wales.

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Now that you know it exists, scaring it up should be a snap. Though that depends on&nbsp;how you approach finding it. When Marsha Robinson of San Jose, California, first set&nbsp;out to find NGC 6400 with her 10-inch f/5.6&nbsp;Dobsonian, she figured it would be easy. But&nbsp;she had some difficulty – until she realized&nbsp;it was in a direct line between G Scorpii and&nbsp;Lambda (<span class="font5">^</span><span class="font19">) Scorpii (Shaula). “Then it was&nbsp;an easy kill,” she said, calling ita “fairly large&nbsp;and lopsided [cluster] with a larger grouping&nbsp;of stars at one side.”</span></p></td>

When I relax my gaze and let the entire scene sweep over&nbsp;me like the wind, I see the cluster as an insect&nbsp;trapped in a black web. This web is comprised of numerous threads of dark nebulosity, which is just a tiny part of the magnificent latticework of dust that drapes this&nbsp;inner spiral arm of our galaxy – one that is&nbsp;seen projected against the southern heartlands of the Milky Way. The dark nebulosity&nbsp;stands out even more if I slightly defocus the&nbsp;image, use averted vision, and relax my gaze.</p></td>

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">When I concentrate solely on NGC 6400 at low power, which is almost a sacrifice,&nbsp;I can see it partially resolved. As Dunlop&nbsp;observed, it is “considerably congregated to&nbsp;the centre, irregular round figure.” At 72<span class="font5">×</span><span class="font19">,&nbsp;all the cluster's details are clear. A thread of&nbsp;stars travels north-northwest from the double, until it branches into a little ellipse with&nbsp;a strong eastern border. Loose, swaggering&nbsp;arms extend to the southwest and east. All&nbsp;told, the cluster's 60-odd members, seen&nbsp;together with the 9th-magnitude pair to the&nbsp;southwest, present a distinct human form,&nbsp;whichlooksuncannilylikeadrunken pirate.&nbsp;And since the long spine of stars connects to&nbsp;a single leg, how could I not see this cluster&nbsp;as the most famous of all the pirates in classical literature – Long John Silver, that heartwarming character created by Robert Louis&nbsp;Stevenson in </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Treasure Island.</span><span class="font19"> There's even&nbsp;a tiny appendage of stars jutting east from&nbsp;the pirate's elliptical head to form a pipe,&nbsp;and three prominent stars extending westnorthwest from the pirate's limp, western&nbsp;shoulder, which can be seen as none other&nbsp;than </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Capt'n Flint,</span><span class="font19"> Long John Silver's parrot, whose famous cries of “Pieces of eight!&nbsp;pieces of eight!” still rings in the ears of our&nbsp;youth.</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">With higher powers, the cluster reveals many fainter suns in no set manner. With&nbsp;imagination, these dimmer congregations&nbsp;of suns make the cluster look like an aerial&nbsp;view of a county fair, with all the stars&nbsp;its people – huddled here, crowded there,&nbsp;yet spread out among the fair ground.&nbsp;So the cluster is very nice for small telescopes and for people with fertile imaginations. Not much is added to the cluster in larger telescopes. Steve Coe of Glendale, Arizona, observing with a 17.5-inch&nbsp;f/4.5 reflector at 100<span class="font5">× </span><span class="font19">sees the cluster as “a&nbsp;long string of stars with several other members.” And Auke Slotegraaf's (Director of the&nbsp;Astronomic Society of South Africa Deepsky&nbsp;ObservingSection)viewthrougha15.5-inch&nbsp;f/9 Newtonian is of a “small open cluster of&nbsp;highly irregular shape lying to the north of&nbsp;an 8th magnitude star. The grouping is very&nbsp;irregular, the pretty bright stars allowing the&nbsp;eye to form many trails and curls; there are&nbsp;at least three star chains and one star loop&nbsp;easily visible. There are roughly two dozen&nbsp;10th magnitude stars here.”</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">NGC 6400 is not a blazing cluster but a simple one, it's a reminder that not all in&nbsp;the sky, as on Earth, has to be dynamic to&nbsp;be beautiful. Not every object in the sky&nbsp;has to be blazing to cause excitement. As&nbsp;Immanuel Kant says in his <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Critique of Practical Reason,</span><span class="font19"> “Two things fill the mind with&nbsp;ever new and increasing admiration and&nbsp;awe, the oftener and the more steadily we&nbsp;reflect on them: the starry heavens above&nbsp;and the moral law within.

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">The location of IC 4665 relative to the galactic plane is suggestive of an environment for star formation that was distinct&nbsp;from that in other open clusters. Given&nbsp;IC 4665's uncharacterstically high galactic&nbsp;latitude, it would be unreasonable to expect&nbsp;that its chemical composition might differ from other nearby clusters closer to&nbsp;the galactic plane. Thus, astronomers have&nbsp;used the ROSAT satellite to investigate other&nbsp;young, nearby clusters to serve as a comparison. In a 1998 <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Astronomical Society of&nbsp;the Pacific Conference Series</span><span class="font19"> publication,&nbsp;M. S. Giampapa (National Optical Astronomy Observatories, National Solar Observatory) and his colleagues, found that the&nbsp;ROSAT data suggest that neither the formation environment nor the formation history&nbsp;of open clusters is reflected in the nature&nbsp;of stellar coronae, at least for clusters with&nbsp;solarlike metallicities.</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">The view of Beta Ophiuchi and IC 4665 under a dark sky with the unaided eye is&nbsp;uncanny, especially if you consider that the&nbsp;cluster is only about a magnitude fainter&nbsp;than the star, yet how much more brilliant&nbsp;Beta appears – these two objects would&nbsp;make an excellent demonstration of how&nbsp;a deep-sky object's size affects its visibility.&nbsp;IC 4665 is 70<span class="font2"><sup>^</sup> </span><span class="font19">in angular extent, which translates to 22 light-years in true physical extent.&nbsp;The beauty of this cluster would have been&nbsp;more enhanced to the naked eye if it were&nbsp;slightly farther away.</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Once I get the cluster in my sights, however, it's hard to let it go. The more time I spend with it, the more mottled the glow&nbsp;appears; the brightest stars in the cluster,&nbsp;after all, are near the limit of naked-eye vis-</p></td>

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;">ibility, and if you get two or more of these stars clumped together, the naked-eye haze&nbsp;should certainly break apart into tiny subsets of stellar hazes.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">But like the Coathanger (Hidden Treasure 97), IC 4665 looks best in binoculars and&nbsp;rich-field telescopes. With 7 <span class="font5">× </span><span class="font19">50 binoculars I could resolve the cluster remarkably well, with 15 or so stars forming a distinct irregular circle at the core with vast&nbsp;double overlapping wings attached to the&nbsp;west and east. The view is glorified at 23</span><span class="font5">×&nbsp;</span><span class="font19">in the 4-inch, which illuminates the clusters' 57-odd members plus numerous field&nbsp;stars in this outer expanse of the Milky&nbsp;Way. Two antennae stretch from the central&nbsp;rosette, and two taillike projections trailing&nbsp;southward from each wing, make the cluster&nbsp;appear like the most distinctive family of all&nbsp;familiar butterflies – the magnificent Swallowtails. In this case the Black Swallowtail&nbsp;found in practically all parts of North America south of Canada. This beautiful insect's&nbsp;black body and wings are lined with bright&nbsp;white spots, like the stars in IC 4665. It is&nbsp;also an appropriate name for this warmweather cluster, since Black Swallowtails fly&nbsp;upon the wing almost any time in warm&nbsp;weather.</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Finally, in his delightful book <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">StarHopping: For Backyard Astronomers</span><span class="font19">, Alan MacRobert notes that the cluster's inner&nbsp;group of bright stars spells the ragged word&nbsp;“HI” when southwest is up. “The greeting is&nbsp;not obvious in the eyepiece,” he says, “until&nbsp;you notice it; then it looks shockingly impertinent. ( Warning: anyone who sends this&nbsp;to the tabloids as proof of alien skywriting&nbsp;earns 100 years of bad karma.)”</span></p></td></tr></table><hr><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"><img src="Hidden Treasures_files/Hidden Treasures-384.jpg" style="width:389pt;height:512pt;"/></div><br clear="all">

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;">Of all the deep-sky objects in the heavens, planetary nebulae are among&nbsp;the most exotic and photogenic. Their&nbsp;largely symmetrical shells take on all manner of colorful shapes and forms, including&nbsp;rings, butterflies, hourglasses, spheres, and&nbsp;eyelike ellipses. And like NGC 6210 (Hidden&nbsp;Treasure 78), the Turtle Nebula in Hercules,&nbsp;our next hidden treasure, NGC 6445, adds&nbsp;another dimension to this celestial zoo of&nbsp;expelled gas – namely, a box.</p></td>
<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Astronomers once believed that the progenitor stars of planetary nebulae simply shed their outermost layer, producing a&nbsp;bubble of slowly expanding material that&nbsp;eventually dissipated into the background&nbsp;interstellar medium. “However,” says Bruce&nbsp;Balick (University of Washington), “the process is far more interesting. Despite their&nbsp;individual differences in complexity, plan-etaries show overall symmetric structure.”&nbsp;What process shapes these stars? Balick sees&nbsp;adonutofejectedmaterial(assumedtohave&nbsp;been expelled earlier) surrounding a whitedwarf nucleus with a fast-flowing wind. The&nbsp;wind flows freely until it rams into the disk&nbsp;along the equator. In other directions the&nbsp;outflowing stellar wind is less inhibited. A&nbsp;hot bubble of expanding gas is formed. “The&nbsp;nebula,” Balick explains, “tends to grow&nbsp;slowest along the equator where the dense&nbsp;torus inhibits its growth, and fastest along&nbsp;the polar direction. The detailed models&nbsp;show that a crucial parameter in governing&nbsp;the evolving shapes of planetary nebulae is&nbsp;the original disk-to-polar density ratio.”</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Then there is the matter of illusion. As planetary nebula expert Sun Kwok explains&nbsp;in his book <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Cosmic Butterflies</span><span class="font19">, “Maybe the&nbsp;different morphologies we see in planetary</span></p></td></tr></table><hr>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;">nebulae are an illusion. They all may have the same intrinsic structure after all...Itis&nbsp;tempting to believe that such&nbsp;diverse morphologies are just&nbsp;different manifestations of a&nbsp;single, unified, basic threedimensional structure.”</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">As early as 1968, Russian astronomerGabrielKhromov&nbsp;and the Czech astronomer&nbsp;Lubos Kohoutek proposed&nbsp;that the different morphologies are an effect of projection, and that many of&nbsp;the observed morphologies&nbsp;can be explained by cylinders with open ends projected at different orientations in the sky. Today, however, astronomers believe the</p><div style="float:right;layout-flow:horizontal;"><img src="Hidden Treasures_files/Hidden Treasures-386.jpg" style="width:255pt;height:267pt;"/></div>
<table cellpadding="7pt">
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;">model of a planetary nebula is a bit more complex. The current thinking, as Kwok&nbsp;explains, is that while the brightest part of&nbsp;the nebula does have the shape of a short&nbsp;cylinder (a torus or donut), its polar extensions have the shape of fans or lobes. “The&nbsp;Torus,” Kwok explains, “having higher densities, forces the outflow from the star to&nbsp;channel through the open ends. After breaking out, the outflow fans out to the side, giving the planetary nebulae a butterfly shape.&nbsp;Looking down the symmetry axis, the nebula looks like a ring with faint halos, exactly&nbsp;like the Ring Nebula. If we rotate this model&nbsp;to different orientations, then the projection&nbsp;to the plane of the sky will give rise to different morphologies.”</p></td>
<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Balick, however, believes that planetary nebulae begin their lives with round and&nbsp;spherical appearances and develop into&nbsp;increasingly asymmetric forms as they age.&nbsp;In this model, interacting winds play an&nbsp;important role in the shaping of the planetary. How does NGC 6445 fit into these&nbsp;models?

Vazquez (Institute of Astronomy, UNAM) and colleagues announced&nbsp;that their studies of the planetary nebula&nbsp;NGC 6445 show it to be an asymmetrical&nbsp;bipolar nebula with a very bright central&nbsp;ring, opened lobes, and finer features.</span></p></td></tr></table><hr>

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">In photographs, NGC 6503 displays a very small, very bright nucleus within a&nbsp;lens that contains bright, tightly wound&nbsp;spiral arms caked with dense star-forming&nbsp;regions. The spiral pattern is similar to that&nbsp;of the multiple-armed galaxy NGC 488 in&nbsp;Pisces, but is much later, and the arms are&nbsp;not as well defined. Individual stars and&nbsp;H-II regions resolve out on red-sensitive&nbsp;platestakenwiththe200-inchtelescope,but&nbsp;theresolutionontheblueplatesisnotnearly&nbsp;as prominent.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">In the mid 1970s, astronomers located a strong, compact radio source (a 17th-magnitude quasar) only about 10,000 light-years from the center of NGC 6503 and&nbsp;in the same plane. It was, at the time,&nbsp;believed to be a best-case possibility for a&nbsp;physical link between galaxies and quasars.&nbsp;In 1976, Halton Arp and his colleagues&nbsp;used a stacked plate photograph to show&nbsp;a filamentary emission feature extending&nbsp;from NGC 6503 in the general direction&nbsp;of the quasar (1749<span class="font5">+</span><span class="font19">70.1). But in a 1981&nbsp;</span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Astronomy and Astrophysics</span><span class="font19"> paper, Seth&nbsp;Shostak (Kapteyn Astronomical Observatory) and his colleagues used the Wester-bork Synthesis Radio Telescope to show no&nbsp;real clear-cut association between the two&nbsp;objects.</span></p></td>
<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">NGC 6503 is also a Seyfert system – meaning the spectrum of its small, intensely bright, nucleus shows strong, broad emission lines. Actually, the nucleus of this&nbsp;galaxy has been classified as a miniature or&nbsp;“transition” Seyfert 2 nucleus – one that&nbsp;shows a broadening of all spectral lines, as&nbsp;opposedtoaSeyfert1nucleus, which shows&nbsp;a broadening of only the hydrogen lines –&nbsp;those that can be associated with the highest gas densities. Either way, the spectral&nbsp;features suggest that the galaxy's core hosts&nbsp;large amounts of very hot, fast-moving gas,&nbsp;which is held in place by the gravitational&nbsp;pull of some large central mass. And while&nbsp;the nature of the central mass is uncertain, it&nbsp;could bea supermassive black hole. Indeed,&nbsp;high-resolution X-ray images by the nowdefunct ROSAT show an extended and elongated source about 10<span class="font2"><sup>^^</sup> </span><span class="font19">from the galaxy's&nbsp;nucleus. The shape and energetics of the diffuse emission could be explained by a sort&nbsp;of intergalactic “hurricane” – a superwind&nbsp;blowing gas at speeds of thousands of kilometers per second away from the nucleus.&nbsp;A black hole could produce the enormous&nbsp;energy required to drive the jetlike wind.&nbsp;The Hubble Space Telescope observed stars&nbsp;along the galaxy's northwest edge and determined a distance of 17 million light-years,&nbsp;only 3 million light-years closer than R.&nbsp;Brent Tully's listing in his </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Nearby Galaxies&nbsp;Catalog.</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">The active galactic nucleus of NGC 6503, then, has been classed as a low ionization nuclear emission region (LINER). It&nbsp;is thought the LINER phenomenon may be&nbsp;the result of a starved monster supermas-sive black hole that is producing very little&nbsp;energy because it is receiving only a slow&nbsp;trickle of food in the form of infalling gas.&nbsp;Nearby galaxy searches have revealed strong&nbsp;evidence to suggest that the nuclei of several&nbsp;of the nearest galaxies may, in fact, contain&nbsp;supermassive black holes, with masses that&nbsp;are several millions to several tens of millions times that of the Sun.</p></td></tr></table><hr><div style="float:left;layout-flow:horizontal;"><img src="Hidden Treasures_files/Hidden Treasures-390.jpg" style="width:256pt;height:264pt;"/></div>

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;">Anyone sweeping his or her telescope across Scorpius, the Scorpion, will find a rich assortment of deep-sky treasures&nbsp;buried in the stellar sands of the Milky&nbsp;Way. Globular cluster NGC 6441 is chief&nbsp;among them, but it is also one of the most&nbsp;obscure. That's because this jewel is lost in&nbsp;the glare of the 3rd-magnitude <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">K</span><span class="font19">-type giant&nbsp;star G Scorpii. The nineteenth-century&nbsp;astronomer James Dunlop discovered this&nbsp;tiny wonder while surveying the southern&nbsp;skies with a 9-inch reflector from Paramatta,&nbsp;New South Wales. He included it as the&nbsp;557th object in his 1827 catalog of southern&nbsp;deep-sky objects, describing it as “a small&nbsp;well-defined rather bright nebula, about&nbsp;20</span><span class="font2"><sup>^^</sup> </span><span class="font19">diameter.” But even the smallest of&nbsp;today's telescopes will show it.</span></p></td>

In&nbsp;fact, the intervening dust in&nbsp;this region of sky is so dense&nbsp;that it diminishes NGC 6441's&nbsp;glow by 0.5 magnitude. If&nbsp;we could see this globular&nbsp;away from the galactic center in a relatively transparent&nbsp;region of sky, like Aquarius, it&nbsp;would teeter on the brink of&nbsp;naked-eye visibility.

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Unlike M2 (a metal-poor, halo object), NGC 6441 is a metal-rich, galactic-bulge&nbsp;globular. Its physical composition and&nbsp;nature more closely resemble that of NGC&nbsp;6624 (HT 91), one of the most metal-rich&nbsp;globular clusters known in the galaxy.

Before Kidd was arrested and hanged&nbsp;for this and other deeds, he allegedly stashed&nbsp;some treasure, which included gold and silver nuggets, on Gardiner's Island near New&nbsp;York (probably as security in case things&nbsp;went wrong); that action perpetuated the&nbsp;myth that pirates always bury their treasure. As David Cordingly writes in </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Under the&nbsp;Black Flag</span><span class="font19">, “Although buried treasure has&nbsp;become a favorite theme in the pirate stories&nbsp;of fiction, there are very few documented&nbsp;examples of real pirates burying their loot.”</span></p></td></tr></table><hr>

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;">Rather than stash and save, pirates preferred to spend their plunder. But because Captain Kidd became one of the most famous&nbsp;pirates of history, “the matter of buried treasure,” Cordingly says, “received more attention than it ever deserved.” While modern-day treasure hunters still search for remnants of Kidd's stash on Gardiner's Island,&nbsp;we will turn our attention to the sky.</p>

Just hold the binoculars steady,&nbsp;look at G, then use averted vision. If you're&nbsp;a true pirate, it'll be hard to concentrate on&nbsp;this task, because so many other treasures&nbsp;surround it. There's the tug of the galaxy's&nbsp;hub, open clusters M6 and M7, and several&nbsp;other stellar gatherings nearby. No wonder&nbsp;NGC 6441 is so overlooked; there's so much&nbsp;to see around it.</p></td>
<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">In my antique telescope the cluster is a slightly swollen disk clearly separated from&nbsp;G Sco. And at 23 <span class="font5">× </span><span class="font19">in the 4-inch, the globular&nbsp;is readily apparent as a tight, bright cometlike glow. A 10th-magnitude star shines only&nbsp;1.5</span><span class="font2"><sup>^</sup> </span><span class="font19">southwest of the cluster's center, and&nbsp;at least three other dimmer field stars surround the cluster even closer; all these&nbsp;stars add to the richness of the scene. With&nbsp;averted vision the cluster has a stellarlike&nbsp;core with an irregular halo. It's almost inconceivable to think that this tiny orb spans&nbsp;107 light-years of space. At 72</span><span class="font5">×</span><span class="font19">, the cluster breaks down into three distinct layers: a&nbsp;dense nucleus, a narrow mantle, and a tenuous outer halo. The brightest stars in the&nbsp;cluster shine around magnitude 15.4, which&nbsp;are near the limit of detectability in a 4-inch. The cluster is so small and tight that&nbsp;it takes magnification well, so use as much&nbsp;as you're comfortable with. Even a slight&nbsp;increase in power, to 101</span><span class="font5">×</span><span class="font19">, will break up&nbsp;the cluster into a mottled haze, like wet cotton – most likely an appearance created by&nbsp;star clumping in such a small disk. Increase&nbsp;the magnification to 182</span><span class="font5">×</span><span class="font19">, and the core will&nbsp;no longer look stellar. Instead it appears as&nbsp;a central orb whose edges diffuse into an&nbsp;irregularly round midsection, which, itself,&nbsp;is surrounded by an “atomic” haze. A few&nbsp;stars or star clumps appear to be resolved&nbsp;in this outer envelope. Truly to resolve this&nbsp;cluster, however, you need a telescope capable of reaching magnitude 17.5.</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">The overall shape of the globular at high power is that of a face-on spiral galaxy.&nbsp;The eastern half of the globular is brighter&nbsp;than the western half. And the core is&nbsp;asymmetrical; it has a “C” shape that curls&nbsp;out from a central pip and is open to the&nbsp;south. Tiny patches of darkness can be&nbsp;seen throughout the cluster with averted&nbsp;vision, but none of them can be pinpointed&nbsp;exactly, they are so diaphanous. One prominent arm fans out from the globular's “mantle” to the east, then curves to the south.&nbsp;Another, thinner arm lies symmetrically&nbsp;opposite it to the west. Other weaker arms&nbsp;can be seen radiating in all directions. In&nbsp;fact, the impression I get is that the globular's arms are somewhat symmetrical, especially the two most obvious components,&nbsp;which look like the arms of a rotating water&nbsp;sprinkler.</p></td></tr></table><hr>

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;">Edward emerson barnard, the most celebrated pirate who ever “sailed”&nbsp;the celestial seas, scrawled his name across&nbsp;the heavens in swashbuckling fashion. A&nbsp;scan of the Milky Way will show his mark&nbsp;repeatedly; just look for the black flags of&nbsp;dark nebulosity, 349 of which bear Barnard's&nbsp;name. Barnard was a virtual “Blackbeard”&nbsp;when it came to astronomical discovery,&nbsp;meaning the man was a living legend.&nbsp;In Captain Johnson's <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">General History of&nbsp;the Pirates,</span><span class="font19"> Blackbeard is described in&nbsp;celestial terms, as a man who “frightened&nbsp;America more than any comet that had&nbsp;appeared there a long time.” While Barnard&nbsp;wasn't likely to frighten anyone, his name&nbsp;is attached to 14 of these “horrifying”&nbsp;apparitions. But it's the sheer number&nbsp;and magnitude of Barnard's other discoveries that really sends a shiver up the&nbsp;spine.</span></p></td>
<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Barnard's name is associated with almost every type of deep-sky object visible in the&nbsp;sky today. The dwarf galaxy NGC 6822 (Caldwell 57) in Sagittarius is Barnard's Galaxy.&nbsp;The California Nebula near Xi (<span class="font5">^ </span><span class="font19">) Persei,&nbsp;part of the Rosette Nebula in Monoceros,&nbsp;and Barnard's Loop (probably a supernova&nbsp;remnant) in Orion are all Barnard finds.

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Between 1905 and 1921, Barnard accumulated 4,000 photographic plates of the Milky Way – each one being a rich trove&nbsp;of astronomical treasure. Anyone would&nbsp;be hard pressed to estimate their wealth.&nbsp;Today, we are still learning more about this&nbsp;man and his proficiencies as a photographer and an observer. For instance, in&nbsp;his monumental work <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">The Immortal Fire&nbsp;Within: The Life and Work of Edward Emerson Barnard</span><span class="font19">, William Sheehan notes that&nbsp;Barnard had imaged Pluto in January 1921,&nbsp;nine years before Clyde Tombaugh discovered the world. These high notes are but&nbsp;part of a larger symphony of discovery&nbsp;that Barnard conducted throughout his life.&nbsp;“Known in his day as a man destined to be&nbsp;‘famous as long as fame shall last',” Sheehan&nbsp;writes, “few figures rivaled his renown, and&nbsp;today he continues to be remembered for&nbsp;the legendary keenness of his sight and his&nbsp;fantastic dedication to astronomy.”</span></p></td></tr></table><hr>

<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">But there is one outstanding discovery by Barnard commonly neglected by visual&nbsp;observers: a rapidly moving star in the constellation Ophiuchus, known as Barnard's&nbsp;Runaway Star or, simply, Barnard's Star. It's&nbsp;funnythatmanymid-NorthernHemisphere&nbsp;observers lament the fact that, unless they&nbsp;travel, they cannot see the closest star system to our Sun: the Alpha Centauri system, with Proxima (4.22 light-years distant)&nbsp;being its closest member. It's funny because&nbsp;they have the second closest star to our Sun&nbsp;after the Alpha Centauri system within easy&nbsp;visual grasp. Lying just 6.0 light-years distant, Barnard's Star shines about two magnitudes brighter than Proxima and can be&nbsp;seen in a well-supported pair of binoculars.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Barnard discovered the star in 1916 while comparing plates he had taken in 1894 and&nbsp;1916 with a “blink comparator” – an instrument that allows two plates of the same part&nbsp;of the sky to be viewed quickly and repeatedly in succession. If anything moves (like&nbsp;a comet or asteroid), or if anything flares to&nbsp;prominence or fades from view (like a variable star), the change is immediately apparent to the observer. But Barnard saw something unexpected – namely a star vanishing&nbsp;from one spot while another star popped&nbsp;intoviewashort distance away. After check-inga 1904 plate of the same region, and then&nbsp;another taken in 1907, Barnard noticed that&nbsp;the appearing and vanishing stars moved&nbsp;chronologically in a straight line. After some&nbsp;puzzlement, he realized what he had found:&nbsp;a star with a high apparent angular rate of&nbsp;motion across the sky (high proper motion).&nbsp;Barnard's Runaway Star, as it was then&nbsp;called, was identified later on plates taken&nbsp;between 1888 and 1890 at Harvard College&nbsp;Observatory.</p></td>

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">The path of Barnard's Star is now clear; it is moving almost due north (position angle&nbsp;355.5<span class="font2"><sup>◦</sup> </span><span class="font19">) at a rate of 1</span><span class="font2"><sup>◦</sup> </span><span class="font19">every 351 years. It has&nbsp;the highest proper motion of any star. Typically, stars close to our Sun have proper&nbsp;motions of about 1</span><span class="font2"><sup>^^</sup> </span><span class="font19">per year. But Barnard's&nbsp;Star cuts across the rich stellar backdrop of&nbsp;the Ophiuchus Milky Way at a clip of 10.3</span><span class="font2"><sup>^^&nbsp;</sup></span><span class="font19">per year. That's equivalent to the apparent&nbsp;diameter of Venus at full phase; in other&nbsp;words, if your telescope can resolve the disk&nbsp;of Venus, you can follow the annual movement of Barnard's Star. The star's apparent&nbsp;rapid motion across the sky is amplified&nbsp;by the fact that the star is approaching us&nbsp;at 140 kilometers per second, indicating a&nbsp;true space velocity of about 166 kilometers&nbsp;per second. The closest approach (3.9 light-years) occurs in 10,000 years. At that time,&nbsp;the star's proper motion will have increased&nbsp;to 25</span><span class="font2"><sup>^^</sup> </span><span class="font19">per year, and its brightness will have&nbsp;increased one hundred-fold.</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Like Proxima Centauri, Barnard's Star is a red dwarf (M3.8V ). It may be an old disk&nbsp;star that formed before the galaxy became&nbsp;enriched with heavy elements. It has less&nbsp;than 17 percent of the Sun's mass, 15 percent of its diameter, and <span class="font17"><sup>1</sup> </span><span class="font19">of its lumi-</span><span class="font17">2500</span></p>

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Astronomers have long suspected the presence of&nbsp;one, if not two, Jupiter-sized&nbsp;planets orbiting Barnard's&nbsp;Star. In the late 1960s, Peter&nbsp;van de Kamp (Sproul Observatory) measured a peculiar&nbsp;wobble in the star's motion&nbsp;across the sky. This wobble,&nbsp;he proposed, was due to&nbsp;a gravitational tug-of-war&nbsp;between the star and planetsized companions. Although&nbsp;van de Kamp devoted most&nbsp;of his life to proving the&nbsp;existence of these invisible&nbsp;dancers, no one has yet</p><div style="float:right;layout-flow:horizontal;"><img src="Hidden Treasures_files/Hidden Treasures-398.jpg" style="width:255pt;height:263pt;"/></div>

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;">been able to verify the claim. In 1995, the year van de Kamp passed away,&nbsp;George G. Gatewood (Allegheny Observatory) announced that while brown dwarfs&nbsp;exceeding Jupiter's mass by more than 10&nbsp;times could not exist around Barnard's Star,&nbsp;planets having a mass smaller than Jupiter's&nbsp;may be present. To date, observations with&nbsp;the Hubble Space Telescope have failed&nbsp;to reveal a large Jupiter or brown dwarfsized object to a limit of about 0.4 Jupiter&nbsp;mass. Although the idea of planets orbiting Barnard's Star is gradually fading from&nbsp;view, a final verdict in this case has not been&nbsp;reached.</p></td>

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;">my antique scope. Don't forget to search for it in binoculars.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">I have to wonder how many of us have seen Barnard's Star. I'll be the first to admit&nbsp;it. Although I've been observing the sky for&nbsp;about half a century and have long known&nbsp;about Barnard's Star, I did not hunt it down&nbsp;until June 2003 – after I had started this&nbsp;project. I've never been at a star party (and&nbsp;I've been to a lot), when a telescope barker&nbsp;shouted out for one and all to come and see&nbsp;this famous runaway star. Yet how easy it is&nbsp;to see, and how wonderfully educational an&nbsp;object it is. Once I saw it, I scolded myself for&nbsp;waiting so long. How much fun it would have&nbsp;been to have tracked this star since childhood.</p></td>
<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Well, enjoy Barnard's Star while you can because it may already be around 10 billion years old; in another 40 billion years&nbsp;it will be on its way to becoming a black&nbsp;dwarf. By the way, did you notice the star's&nbsp;third nickname listed in the table above?&nbsp;After Barnard's discovery of the Runaway&nbsp;Star, the staff of Yerkes Observatory named&nbsp;it “Gilpin,” after a character in a poem&nbsp;by William Cowper entitled <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">The Diverting History of John Gilpin</span><span class="font19">. Gilpin, a linendraper living north of London, is unable to&nbsp;restrain his horse and gallops 10 miles to&nbsp;Ware.</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">I've bestowed yet another poetical name on the star: “O-bah-bahm-wawa-ge-zhe-go-qua.” You see, Henry Rowe Schoolcraft,&nbsp;a renowned historian, pioneering explorer,&nbsp;and geologist – who was also superintendent of Indian affairs for Michigan from&nbsp;1836 to 1841– was married to Jane Johnston, a descendant of the Ojibway Indians&nbsp;of northern Michigan. Jane's Indian name&nbsp;is O-bah-bahm-wawa-ge-zhe-go-qua (The&nbsp;Woman of the Sound Which the Stars Make&nbsp;Rushing Through the Sky). If there is a star in&nbsp;the northernsky that should bear her Indian&nbsp;name, Barnard's Star is it.</p></td></tr></table><hr><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"><img src="Hidden Treasures_files/Hidden Treasures-400.jpg" style="width:389pt;height:512pt;"/></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;">

One long, loose, arm flies off&nbsp;the circlet to the north, then curves around&nbsp;to the east. A tighter spiral swings from east&nbsp;to south, and two parallel arms jut out to the&nbsp;west. All told, I count only about 30 stars.&nbsp;Twice that number, though, are true members. The cluster, then, must be glorious in&nbsp;larger apertures.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">The two brightest stars at the cluster's southern fringe shine with a tangerine hue.&nbsp;Together with the ruby heart of the cluster and the blood-red magnitude 6.7 star&nbsp;to the west, it's apparent that we are seeing two ages of stars juxtaposed. The 60&nbsp;or so hot blue stars that truly belong to&nbsp;NGC 6520 lie only about 5,300 light-years&nbsp;distant and have an estimated age of 800&nbsp;million years. In true physical extent they&nbsp;span about 8 light-years of space. Shining&nbsp;through these young suns are a handful of&nbsp;red giants, billions of years old. Most likely,&nbsp;they are distant field stars that belong to&nbsp;our galaxy's ancient hub, into which we are&nbsp;peering.</p></td>
<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">I also call this cluster the Dead Man's Chest because the red magnitude 6.7 star is&nbsp;part of a chain of four stars in a slight arc. It&nbsp;looks as if a bleeding man is lying prostrate&nbsp;next to a chest filled with precious jewels.&nbsp;There also appears to be a hint of glowing&nbsp;nebulosity, extremely tenuous, surrounding&nbsp;the four stars that make up the bleeding&nbsp;man; it's as if the dead man's spirit is leaving&nbsp;his body.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">There's an added treat for visual observers. Wedged between NGC 6520&nbsp;and the magnitude 6.7 star is one of the&nbsp;sky's blackest nebulae – Barnard 86. Edward&nbsp;Emerson Barnard discovered this “small&nbsp;triangular hole in the Milky Way, as black as&nbsp;midnight,” on July 17, 1883. At the time he&nbsp;was sweeping for comets from his home in&nbsp;Nashville, Tennessee. As William Sheehan&nbsp;explains in his biography of the great&nbsp;man, <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">The Immortal Fire Within</span><span class="font19">, Barnard&nbsp;later described it as “a most remarkable small inky black hole in a crowded&nbsp;part of the Milky Way . . . with a bright&nbsp;orange star on its [north preceding] border&nbsp;and a beautiful little cluster [NGC 6520]&nbsp;following.”</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;padding:0pt 0pt 17pt 0pt;">Six years later, on August 1, 1889, Barnard took his first successful photograph of the&nbsp;Milky Way. It was of the same region of Sagittarius, because it possessed “the most intricate and complex structure of any portion&nbsp;of the Milky Way above our horizon.” Here&nbsp;is how he described that plate:</p>
<p class="font18" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:1pt;padding:0pt 0pt 6pt 9pt;">This remarkable picture shows the cloud-like forms like waves of spray.A...curving lane [of&nbsp;darkness] runs from the lower left-hand portion of the picture . . . and curves gracefully&nbsp;upwards to the place of <span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">Jupiter</span><span class="font18">. It is singularly&nbsp;like the stem of a great leaf. At the middle of the&nbsp;picture it is seen to pass behind some of the&nbsp;clouds of stars and emerge beyond, showing&nbsp;us clearly which part of the Milky Way at that&nbsp;point is nearest to us. Imagination may aid one,&nbsp;but it looks as if the lines of the cloud-forms,&nbsp;and of the stars and vacancies, all run more or&nbsp;less concentric with this extensive lane . . . The&nbsp;black hole is seen slightly to the left of the center, with the small cluster [NGC 6520] as a white&nbsp;spot close to the right of it.</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;">If you have the chance to explore this region with a wide field of view, be sure to circumnavigate NGC 6520 with averted vision. The&nbsp;cluster, you may see, lies at the intersection&nbsp;of a much larger “X” of dark lanes. Like those&nbsp;old maps of buried treasure then . . . X marks&nbsp;the spot.</p></td></tr></table><hr><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"><img src="Hidden Treasures_files/Hidden Treasures-403.jpg" style="width:389pt;height:512pt;"/></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;">

Globular cluster NGC 6544 is one of those&nbsp;easy to see objects that's all but lost in the&nbsp;crowd of bright clusters and nebulosities&nbsp;that populate the Milky Way's hub around&nbsp;M8, the renowned Lagoon Nebula, which&nbsp;has been called by some the Orion Nebula&nbsp;of the South.

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">In 7 <span class="font5">× </span><span class="font19">50 binoculars and the antique scope, the globular is a fairly round but compact glow with a bright, starlike nucleus.&nbsp;Indeed, NGC 6544's core measures only 3</span><span class="font2"><sup>^&nbsp;</sup></span><span class="font19">in diameter and is the cluster's most prominent feature. It appears that the intense&nbsp;gravitational pull of so many stars in such&nbsp;a small volume seems to be causing stars&nbsp;to converge on the cluster's core like bees&nbsp;swarming to their hive. Such a collapse&nbsp;may be the process responsible for creating such exotic objects as X-ray pulsars, blue&nbsp;stragglers, and, possibly (though doubtfully), black holes. “A black hole has been&nbsp;suggested to exist at the center of M15,&nbsp;and also G1 in M31,” Canadian astrophysicist William Harris (MacMaster University)&nbsp;notes, “but these are still just suggestions,&nbsp;and there are other more mundane and&nbsp;less exciting ways to interpret the measurements.

<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Since the cluster is so small and tight, it begs for high power. At 101<span class="font5">×</span><span class="font19">, the cluster is very mottled. The cluster's brightest&nbsp;stars (12.8 magnitude) form a northwest–&nbsp;southeast-trending line across the core. A&nbsp;dimmer arm extends from the southeast&nbsp;end of that line and connects to the solitary 12th-magnitude star. So with averted&nbsp;vision, the brightest portions of the globular have a sideways V-shaped pattern.

With a horizontal branch magnitude of 15.0, observers&nbsp;with even modest-sized telescopes should&nbsp;be able to resolve many of the cluster's&nbsp;fainter stars – more so than in some of the&nbsp;dimmer Messier globulars.</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">At higher power the core becomes a stellar point surrounded by a nearly complete, though highly mottled, ring of star clumps. The ring is open to the southwest where a very dim arm extends to the&nbsp;12th-magnitude star. A faint arm extends to&nbsp;the northeast before gently curving north.&nbsp;And fragmentary clumps of stars can be&nbsp;seen to the northwest and east. Overall,&nbsp;the brightest stars form a starfish-shaped&nbsp;pattern, so I call it the Starfish Cluster. Despite some claims that “if you've&nbsp;seen one globular, you've seen them all,”&nbsp;no two globulars are alike. In a 12-inch&nbsp;scope, Brian Skiff and Christian Luginbuhl&nbsp;say that NGC 6544 is a “pretty sight at&nbsp;low power, sparkling throughout, with its&nbsp;bright stars near the center looking like a&nbsp;nucleus.”</p></td></tr></table><hr><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"><img src="Hidden Treasures_files/Hidden Treasures-406.jpg" style="width:389pt;height:512pt;"/></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all">

And&nbsp;what a wonder! Wilhelm von Struve, who&nbsp;discovered NGC 6572 in 1925 with the&nbsp;9.6-inch Fraunhofer refractor at Dorpat&nbsp;Observatory (see also Hidden Treasure 78),&nbsp;described it as one of the most curious&nbsp;objects in the heavens – “it being a star&nbsp;surrounded by bright green ellipse of fuzzy&nbsp;light.” In early photographic images, the&nbsp;nebula was classified as an “atmosphere”&nbsp;type – meaning that the nebula's light&nbsp;decreases uniformly outward from a bright&nbsp;core, like the atmosphere around a planet.</p></td>
<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">In 1925, not much was known about the nature of planetary nebulae. In 1922 Edwin&nbsp;Hubble had noticed that larger planetary&nbsp;nebulae have brighter central stars, and&nbsp;concluded that the nebulae must extract&nbsp;their energy from the star. A few years prior,&nbsp;Heber Curtis (Lick Observatory) compared&nbsp;his photographs of planetary nebulae with&nbsp;models of suspended fluids viewed by transmitted light, and concluded that nebulae&nbsp;showing a pronounced ring effect can be&nbsp;treated as homogeneous shells of various&nbsp;forms. Of course, we now know that the&nbsp;morphology of planetary nebulae are much&nbsp;more elaborate (see Hidden Treasure 84).</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">NGC 6572 is a compact planetary of very high surface brightness; not only is&nbsp;it 1.5 magnitudes brighter than M57 (the&nbsp;Ring Nebula) in Lyra, but also some five&nbsp;times smaller. In photographs, the nebula's&nbsp;structure appears simple: a bright ring surrounded by an amorphous halo with no filaments. Viewed in three dimensions, the&nbsp;nebula is most likely a thin cylinder of light,</p></td></tr></table><hr>

The nebula is expanding&nbsp;away from the central star at about 16 kilometers per second – about the speed that&nbsp;an average meteor travels in Earth's atmosphere.</p>

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">When I moved on to 182<span class="font5">×</span><span class="font19">, then to 303</span><span class="font5">×</span><span class="font19">, I really began to “see things.” I still couldn't&nbsp;shake the thought that I could detect outer&nbsp;nebulosity. But this was only an illusion.&nbsp;“NGC 6572 is probably too young and compact of a planetary nebula to have much&nbsp;of a ‘true' extended halo,” says Jay McNeil,&nbsp;the visual guru of planetary nebulae. “Sure,&nbsp;there's definitely some tenuous material&nbsp;that was flung out pretty far from the main&nbsp;nebula by the progenitor star while it was&nbsp;still a red giant. On the other hand, NGC&nbsp;6572 is considered to be ‘optically-thick.'&nbsp;This means that nearly all of the radiation&nbsp;emittedfromthecurrentcentralstarisbeing&nbsp;absorbed by the surrounding dense shell&nbsp;that forms the high surface-brightness disk&nbsp;that we see (hence its wonderful efficiency&nbsp;at producing the vivid blue-green color via&nbsp;the absorption of such ultraviolet radiation&nbsp;and reemitting it at the OIII lines). Generally, it is only once that this ‘denser' material has thinned out some that enough of the&nbsp;radiation can escape the inner shell in order&nbsp;to illuminate the really faint outer stuff. On&nbsp;the Digital Sky Survey, I see that there are&nbsp;several stars of about the same magnitude&nbsp;within a 1</span><span class="font2"><sup>^</sup> </span><span class="font19">radius of the nebula. I do agree&nbsp;that at lower powers under excellent transparency, these would likely form an illusive&nbsp;‘fuzziness' around the brighter nebula.”</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">McNeil's visual observations with a 16-inch reflector at 586<span class="font5">× </span><span class="font19">under very steady seeing conditions showed a very compact and high-surface-brightness elliptical&nbsp;disk, evenly illuminated, elongated slightly&nbsp;north–south, and appearing about 12</span><span class="font2"><sup>^^</sup> </span><span class="font19">in&nbsp;greatest dimension. This “inner” disk was&nbsp;surrounded by a much fainter diffuse “halo”&nbsp;oriented in the same direction and extending to maybe 20</span><span class="font2"><sup>^^</sup> </span><span class="font19">at greatest. The brighter&nbsp;portion of the nebula was vividly greenish-blue in color, especially at powers below&nbsp;200 </span><span class="font5">×</span><span class="font19">. At higher powers, the nebula's apparent brightness and color faded. “However,&nbsp;the nebula's 13th-magnitude central star,”&nbsp;he says, “can be easily spotted toward the&nbsp;object's center.”</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">There is much confusion over the visible nature of the planetary's central star. It has&nbsp;been seen as 10th magnitude and as faint&nbsp;as 14th. Houston said, “such are the problems when trying to estimate a star's magnitude when it appears against a bright background.” There are several reports of the star&nbsp;not being seen with 10-inch instruments. If&nbsp;you search for it, remember to use the highest magnification possible. Doing so dims&nbsp;the appearance of the nebula and increases&nbsp;the contrast between the star and its background. Hartung noted that this remarkable&nbsp;planetary nebula “shows a small disk 10<span class="font2"><sup>^^&nbsp;</sup></span><span class="font19">across and in the prism the strong image is&nbsp;followed by another less bright on the violet side, with evidence of a third still farther&nbsp;along; these come from ionized oxygen and&nbsp;hydrogen. There is alsoa long thin spectrum&nbsp;streak, stronger towards the red, which is&nbsp;that of the otherwise invisible central star.”</span></p></td></tr></table><hr>

The dense inner nebula has a greenish tinge. Walter Scott Houston noted that his “old 10-inch reflector&nbsp;showed the vivid green color of this object&nbsp;with any power more than 50</span><span class="font5">×</span><span class="font19">.” He also&nbsp;noted that older observers see NGC 6572&nbsp;as green, while younger ones tend to call it&nbsp;“vivid blue.” Admittedly, nothing I've seen&nbsp;or read, compares with the view of NGC&nbsp;6572throughLarryMitchell's36-inchreflec-tor. Here was an incredible neon green beacon – of a color and brilliance so powerful&nbsp;that I could see it with sunglasses on.

<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">It is fitting that the neon beauty of NGC 6572, a planetary nebula, being the&nbsp;product of eruptive processes at the central&nbsp;star's core, be seen as the ultimate demise&nbsp;ofthe planet Krypton. As Superman's father,&nbsp;Jor-El, warned the inhabitants of Krypton&nbsp;before the end, “[t]he core of Krypton is&nbsp;composed of a substance called uranium,&nbsp;which, for untold ages, has been setting up&nbsp;a cycle of chain-impulses, building in power&nbsp;every moment. Soon, very soon, every atom&nbsp;of Krypton will explode in one final terrible&nbsp;blast.Kryptonisonegiganticatomicbomb.”&nbsp;Alas, the end came in one final cataclysmic&nbsp;eruption and the once mighty planet Krypton exploded into stardust. So the next time&nbsp;you look at NGC 6572, use your imagination&nbsp;and behold its green shell as the ultimate&nbsp;demise of Superman's home planet.</p></td></tr></table><hr><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"><img src="Hidden Treasures_files/Hidden Treasures-410.jpg" style="width:389pt;height:512pt;"/></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;">

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Although NGC 6624 is seen against the central hub of our galaxy, which presents&nbsp;professional astronomers with the problems of interstellar reddening and field-star&nbsp;contamination, the cluster is well studied.&nbsp;The aged cluster has been literally dissected&nbsp;by astronomers using the Hubble Space&nbsp;Telescope (HST), who have determined that&nbsp;NGC 6624 has resided in the galactic bulge&nbsp;for nearly the last 14 billion years, making it another extremely aged globular cluster, like M69 in Sagittarius and the magnificent southern globular cluster 47 Tucanae&nbsp;(Caldwell 106).

These&nbsp;enigmatic stars, called blue stragglers, are&nbsp;most likely formed either when the stars&nbsp;in a double-star system slowly merge, or&nbsp;when two unrelated stars collide. The HST&nbsp;detected at least ten candidate blue stragglers within five arcseconds of NGC 6624's&nbsp;center. The HST also found evidence for&nbsp;an unusual double-star system at the very&nbsp;heart of the cluster – a neutron star (a citysized collapsed core of some ancient supernova explosion) and a white-dwarf companion (a planet-sized remnant of a burned out&nbsp;Sun-likestar),whichorbitoneanotherevery&nbsp;eleven minutes; it is the fastest binary system known. The stars are only 161,000 kilometers apart, or less than half the distance&nbsp;between the Earth and Moon.</p></td>
<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Intense X-rays are being emitted from the system. No doubt, the fierce gravitational pull of the neutron star is ripping&nbsp;away gas from the white dwarf, which is&nbsp;slowly being cannibalized. The stolen gas&nbsp;forms a swirling disk around the neutron&nbsp;star, which heats upto temperatures greater&nbsp;than 100,000 <span class="font2"><sup>◦</sup> </span><span class="font19">F. A steady stream of X-rays&nbsp;is then emitted as the gas falls onto the&nbsp;star. The infall of matter also supplies fuel&nbsp;for sporadic, intense X-ray bursts. These&nbsp;occur when enough gas accumulates on the&nbsp;surface of the neutron star to ignite spontaneously, creating an enormous nuclear&nbsp;fusion explosion. For a few seconds, the outburst abruptly outshines the usual steady X-ray emission.</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">To find this beautiful object, just center Delta Sagittarii in your telescope, then move&nbsp;slowly 45<span class="font2"><sup>^</sup> </span><span class="font19">to the southeast.

Look also for two stubby&nbsp;extensions: one to the southeast, which spirals toward&nbsp;the west, and another to the&nbsp;south. The outer halo is sprinkled with dim suns. Seen&nbsp;together, all these wispy arms&nbsp;make the cluster look like a&nbsp;spider web being stretched by&nbsp;an unseen hand. All the arms&nbsp;become much more apparent with 182 .</span></p>

You'll find NGC 6624 at the southwest end of a 7<span class="font2"><sup>^</sup></span><span class="font19">-wide chain&nbsp;of three “stars”; the other two stars shine&nbsp;around 10th magnitude, so they are reasonably dimmer.

Take the time&nbsp;to scan the cluster carefully with averted&nbsp;vision, and see ifit doesnotstart to break up&nbsp;into mottled bits. The brightest stars in the&nbsp;cluster shine at 14th magnitude, so the combined light of clumped members should pop&nbsp;in and out of view, especially in the outer&nbsp;halo.

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">The southern edge of the cluster's outer envelope forms a discreet arc that seems&nbsp;to spiral to the west. A tighter arc – one&nbsp;closer to the nuclear region – lies to the&nbsp;north. You could spend hours trying to ferret out the secrets of this dense globular&nbsp;with a small telescope. The more time you&nbsp;spend with it, the more you will see – like&nbsp;a tiny spike of stars flowing gracefully to&nbsp;the north-northwest, another to the south;&nbsp;a sprinkling of suns here, a clump of suns&nbsp;there. All these details waver in and out&nbsp;of view, depending on how you move your&nbsp;eye.</p></td>

The coreis so tightI had no problem&nbsp;staying with it, resolving it, while stars disappeared from the sky. Alas, there's only so&nbsp;much time you can give to a globular before&nbsp;you go mad with delight or frustration,&nbsp;because the patterns you see keep changing&nbsp;as you strive to resolve more and more stars.&nbsp;The view must be more astounding in larger&nbsp;telescopes. For instance, Hartung says that&nbsp;a 12-inch telescope will resolve this cluster&nbsp;into “faint stars scattering away in diffuse&nbsp;edges.”</span></p>

The chapter describes Alice's&nbsp;encounter with the “fat little,” pugilistic&nbsp;twins called Tweedledum and Tweedledee.&nbsp;Since the publication of Carroll's book, the&nbsp;twins' names have become synonymous&nbsp;with any two people, places, or things worthy of comparison. And so it was inthe fall of&nbsp;2003, when I spied two magnificent naked-eye open clusters – NGC 6633 and IC 4756 –&nbsp;standing side by side on the banks of the&nbsp;river Milky Way. For the first time in four&nbsp;decades I was absolutely dumbfounded by&nbsp;what I was seeing. I was so taken by their&nbsp;appearance, and so stunned that they had&nbsp;escaped my gaze for so long, that I immediately changed my </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Hidden Treasures</span><span class="font19"> list to&nbsp;incorporate them. I did not want much time&nbsp;to pass without notifying others of these&nbsp;secret gems.</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:9pt;">The two clusters do share some common traits. Both shine at magnitude 4.3 and can be seen without optical aid. They also&nbsp;lie at comparable distances from the Sun.&nbsp;Both are “fat” with stars: NGC 6633 spans&nbsp;20<span class="font2"><sup>^</sup> </span><span class="font19">in apparent diameter and IC 4756 is&nbsp;twice as large.

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">In honor of Carroll's two chubby twins, I dubbed NGC 6633 and IC 4756, Tweedledum and Tweedledee, respectively. After I&nbsp;had logged these names, I found the two&nbsp;clusters in the <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Millennium Star Atlas</span><span class="font19"> and&nbsp;was surprised to see a 6th-magnitude star&nbsp;(Struve 2375) in Serpens Cauda, 1</span><span class="font17"><sub>2</sub><sup>1 </sup></span><span class="font2"><sup>◦</sup> </span><span class="font19">due&nbsp;west of IC 4756, with the name “Tweedledee&nbsp;and Tweedledum.” Struve 2375 is a double&nbsp;star with a magnitude 6.3 primary and a&nbsp;6.7 secondary 2.2</span><span class="font2"><sup>^^</sup> </span><span class="font19">apart (2003). Both stars&nbsp;are themselves spectroscopic binaries, so&nbsp;foreveryTweedledeethereisaTweedledum&nbsp;and vice versa. This region of space, then, is&nbsp;almost as bizarre as Lewis Carroll's tale; it's&nbsp;as if Tweedledum and Tweedledee are peering into a looking glass that's being reflected&nbsp;by a looking glass, so the twins are seeing&nbsp;multiple and successively smaller images of&nbsp;themselves.</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">The Swiss astronomer and mathematician Jean Philippe Loys de Che´seaux (1718– 1751) was the first person to discover&nbsp;NGC 6633. It was one of 20 such objects&nbsp;he found between the years 1745–1746, at&nbsp;least eight of which were genuine nebulae or&nbsp;clusters that had not been previously seen;&nbsp;NGC 6633 was one of them. De Che´seaux&nbsp;had prepared a list of these discoveries,&nbsp;which was read before the Academie Royale&nbsp;des Sciences on August 6, 1746. Unfortunately, the list was not otherwise published,&nbsp;though Guillaume le Gentil knew of it in&nbsp;1759. But, as Kenneth Glyn Jones explains&nbsp;in his book <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">The Search for the Nebulae</span><span class="font19">,&nbsp;Messier was not aware of de Che´seaux's&nbsp;contributions to this field when he later&nbsp;rediscovered six of de Che´seaux's objects&nbsp;and included them in his 1771 catalog. And&nbsp;while Messier did not independently discover NGC 6633, Caroline Herschel did in&nbsp;1783. While sweeping the heavens with a&nbsp;4.2-inch reflector, which gave her a power&nbsp;of 24</span><span class="font5">× </span><span class="font19">and a field of view a little larger than&nbsp;2</span><span class="font2"><sup>◦</sup> </span><span class="font19">, she found, “About halfway from S Ser-pentarii[Ophiuchi]towardsthetaSerpentis,&nbsp;a Cluster of large stars.

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Alas, de Che´seaux's discoveries went unnoticed until the late nineteenth century,&nbsp;when Bigourdan included most of them in&nbsp;a “List of Nebulae and Clusters Discovered&nbsp;from 1700 to 1750,” published in the 1884&nbsp;Paris <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Annales</span><span class="font19">.</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Without question, de Che´seaux was a giftedobserver.Inalettertohisgrandfather,&nbsp;de Che´seaux made this comment about his&nbsp;discoveries, “I have observed most of these&nbsp;nebulae and have found none, other than&nbsp;the first, – that of Andromeda, – which truly&nbsp;deserved the name.

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Of NGC 6633, specifically, de Che´ seaux wrote, “Near the tail of Serpens in which&nbsp;there is a small cluster of stars, a little separated from the rest towards the&nbsp;West.” Although his description is simple,&nbsp;it is nonetheless intriguing and, perhaps,&nbsp;telling. After doing some initial research on&nbsp;NGC 6633, I had to wonder why de Che´ seaux&nbsp;and other great observers after him – such&nbsp;as Charles Messier, William Herschel, James&nbsp;Dunlop, and John Herschel – had failed to&nbsp;see the equally bright, albeit larger, open&nbsp;cluster IC 4756 only 3<span class="font2"><sup>◦</sup> </span><span class="font19">to the east. In fact,&nbsp;IC 4756 was not discovered visually at all.&nbsp;Harvard astronomer Solon Bailey found the&nbsp;cluster on plates taken with the 1-inch f/13&nbsp;Cook lens at Harvard's Arequipa station in&nbsp;Peru, as part of a systematic search forbright&nbsp;clusters and nebulae. IC 4765 continued to&nbsp;beaproblemchildafterBailey'sdiscoveryof&nbsp;it. In </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Star Clusters</span><span class="font19">, Brent Archinal and Steven&nbsp;Hynes explain in elaborate detail how the&nbsp;cluster was independently discovered by K.&nbsp;Graff in 1922 (IC 4756 </span><span class="font5">= </span><span class="font19">Graff 1), but various&nbsp;sources misidentified, confused, or erroneously listed Graff 1 and IC 4756 as separate&nbsp;objects.</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Thata 4th-magnitude open cluster would remain elusive to the greatest visual&nbsp;observers of the eighteenth and nineteenth&nbsp;centuries seemed odd – until I realized the&nbsp;importance of de Che´ seaux's words, that&nbsp;NGC 6633 is “a little separated from the rest&nbsp;towards the West.” What did de Che´seaux&nbsp;mean by “the rest?” A glance at the sky – or&nbsp;even a photograph – will reveal the answer.&nbsp;IC 4756 lies at the southwestern tip of a thin&nbsp;Milky Way star cloud, which is separated&nbsp;from NGC 6633 by a dark lagoon of obscuring cloud. While IC 4756 can be seen with&nbsp;the naked eye as a patch of diffuse light,&nbsp;it is seen against the splendor of the Milky&nbsp;Way. Couple this fact with another fact – that&nbsp;IC 4756 is twice as large as NGC 6633 – and&nbsp;the reason for its secrecy becomes clear. Had&nbsp;de Che´seaux turned either his 4.2-meter&nbsp;focal length, or 60-centimeter focal length,&nbsp;telescope toward IC 4765, he would have&nbsp;seen just a spread of unconcentrated stars&nbsp;in his tiny field of view. The magic of IC&nbsp;4765 seen with the naked eye would have&nbsp;vanished just as magically when a telescope&nbsp;was trained on it, for the cluster would&nbsp;have diffused out and appeared no different</p></td></tr></table><hr>

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">NGC 6633, on the other hand, stands apart from the&nbsp;milky band that includes&nbsp;IC 4756. Furthermore, its&nbsp;bright and concentrated core&nbsp;would have stood out from&nbsp;“the rest” of the Milky Way&nbsp;as a “cluster.” Observers after&nbsp;de Che´seaux would have&nbsp;had the same problem with&nbsp;their limited fields of view.&nbsp;Walter Scott Houston concurred, writing, “The Herschels probably missed it&nbsp;because the small fields of</p><div style="border:solid;float:right;layout-flow:horizontal;">

IC 4756 appears as a patch&nbsp;of Milky Way to the unaided eye.” Here we&nbsp;have yet another irony of the night sky: until&nbsp;rich-field telescopes came into vogue, some&nbsp;of the bright yet diffuse deep-sky objects&nbsp;remained beyond the reach of telescopic&nbsp;observers and therefore defied imaging –&nbsp;even though they could be seen with the&nbsp;unaided eye. The effect is reminiscent of&nbsp;these words about “beauty” by the Elizabethan poet Anthony Munday (1553–1633):&nbsp;“When fond imagination / Seemed to see,&nbsp;but could not tell / Her feature or her fashion.” Seeing IC 4756 in a powerful telescope&nbsp;with a narrow field is like trying to drive&nbsp;under a rainbow; the closer one sees it the&nbsp;more diffuse and obscure it becomes.</p></td>
<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Because NGC 6633 and IC 4756 lie at similar distances and share a similar age&nbsp;(about 600 million years), and because both&nbsp;are relatively large in apparent diameter&nbsp;yet well defined, they are perfect candidates for studying the evolution of stellar activity between them and between&nbsp;other large and well-defined open star clusters of similar age – such as the Prae-sepe (M44), Coma Berenices (Hidden Treasure 62), and the Hyades (Caldwell 41).&nbsp;Open star clusters are key to studies of&nbsp;stellar evolution because they can usually be considered to contain stars that&nbsp;were all born at the same time. Observations of young open clusters like NGC 6633&nbsp;and IC 4756 have been used to investigate&nbsp;theories about stellar evolution.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">For instance, in a classical view, lithium is supposed to decay asa star ages. And observations of solar-type stars in open clusters show this to be the case. Indeed, in a&nbsp;2002 <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Monthly Notices</span><span class="font19"> of the Royal Astronomical Society, Rob Jeffries (Keele University) and his colleagues found that the&nbsp;spectrum of solar-type stars in NGC 6633&nbsp;shows a strong lithium depletion at approximately the same temperature range as solartype stars in the Hyades. And at cooler&nbsp;temperatures, the lithium abundance patterns are remarkably similar to those in&nbsp;Hyades, Praesepe, and Coma Berenices.&nbsp;But cross comparisons of lithium depletion&nbsp;in star clusters are not entirely uniform.&nbsp;The stars of late-</span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">G</span><span class="font19"> and </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">K</span><span class="font19"> spectral types in&nbsp;NGC 6633, have used up less lithium than&nbsp;their Hyades counterparts. To find out what&nbsp;causes these differences, astronomers have&nbsp;begun using the new generation of large&nbsp;telescopes (like the Kecks), coupled with&nbsp;efficient high-resolution spectrographs, to&nbsp;study solar- and later-type stars in open&nbsp;clusters covering a wide range of ages and&nbsp;metallicities.Sincelithiumisobservedtobe&nbsp;correlatedbothwithstellaractivityandrota-tion, studies of lithium depletion in solartype stars of different ages may some day&nbsp;unlock the secrets to understanding the&nbsp;physical processes that drive stellar evolution both before and during a star's life on&nbsp;the main sequence.</span></p></td></tr></table><hr>

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Finding NGC 6633 and IC 4756 is simple. If you are under a dark sky, just look for two hazy 4th-magnitude globes halfway&nbsp;between magnitude 4.6 Theta (<span class="font5">^ </span><span class="font19">) Serpens&nbsp;Cauda – a glorious lemon-yellow double&nbsp;star resolvable in binoculars – and the&nbsp;similarly bright pair of stars, 71 and 72&nbsp;Ophiuchi, which mark the tip of Taurus&nbsp;Poniatovii's western horn. From suburban&nbsp;locations, just raise your binoculars to this&nbsp;spot; the clusters will be unmistakable.</span></p></td>
<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">If you would like to see a perfect demonstration of how an object's apparent size affects its appearance, just look at Theta Ser&nbsp;and 72 Oph, both of which shine at magnitude 4.6. Next, compare these stars with&nbsp;NGC 6633, which has a catalog magnitude of&nbsp;4.6 but is 20<span class="font2"><sup>^</sup> </span><span class="font19">in apparent diameter, and then&nbsp;with IC 4756, which also has a catalog magnitude of 4.6 but is 40</span><span class="font2"><sup>^</sup> </span><span class="font19">in apparent diameter.&nbsp;M44, the famous Beehive Cluster in Cancer,&nbsp;the Crab, is a little more than 1-magnitude&nbsp;brighterthanIC4756and </span><span class="font17"><sub>2</sub><sup>1 </sup></span><span class="font2"><sup>◦</sup> </span><span class="font19">larger in apparent size. Beyond its greater brilliance, what&nbsp;makes M44 so much more obvious to see&nbsp;than IC 4756? The answer is the absence of&nbsp;Milky Way in Cancer. Still, I have to wonder how it is that I did not notice NGC 6633&nbsp;and IC 4756 in almost a decade of deepsky observing under dark skies. The clusters are just dim enough to avoid a casual&nbsp;sweep of the heavens. But once you know&nbsp;where to look, they are easy and quite obvious, especially with averted vision. The situation reminds me of seeing Venus in the daytime sky. If you know exactly where to look,&nbsp;Venus can be easy to see. But just try and&nbsp;find Venus blindly and, chances are, you'll&nbsp;fail.</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">On the evening of July 31, 2003, Larry Mitchell (Houston, Texas) and I drove to the&nbsp;nearly 14,000-foot-high summit of Mauna&nbsp;Kea in Hawaii and observed NGC 6633 and&nbsp;IC 4756 with our naked eyes and binoculars. Both have stars that the naked eye can&nbsp;resolve, or at least make the clusters appear&nbsp;patchy. The brightest stars in both clusters&nbsp;shine at 8th magnitude, and while it is possible to see these faint magnitudes from the&nbsp;summit of Mauna Kea, my guess would be&nbsp;that, for the most part, the naked-eye resolution is actually of star clumps not individual&nbsp;stars. Seeing these wonders together from&nbsp;such a magnificent location was like seeing&nbsp;the Double Cluster (Caldwell 14) in Perseus&nbsp;from a closer vantage point in space. Both&nbsp;clusters vie for attention and each has its&nbsp;own facets of visual splendor.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">In true physical extent, NGC 6633 spans 5.8 light-years of space, while IC 4756 spans&nbsp;15.2 light-years. Interestingly, the brightest&nbsp;componentoftheDoubleCluster(NGC869)</p></td></tr></table><hr>

But this is an illusion.&nbsp;In reality, both components of the Double&nbsp;Cluster span 38 light-years of space, it's just&nbsp;that we see them seven times fartheraway. If&nbsp;we could place NGC 6633 and IC 4756 at the&nbsp;distance of the Double Cluster, they would&nbsp;vanish from naked-eye visibility. NGC 6633&nbsp;would be an 8th-magnitude glow measuring&nbsp;amere3<span class="font2"><sup>^</sup> </span><span class="font19">inapparentdiameter,whileIC4756&nbsp;would be an 8th-magnitude glow twice as&nbsp;large.

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Like some precious gem, NGC 6633 has a way of possessing the hearts of those who&nbsp;see it for the first time. For instance, Houston writes that when Canadian amateur&nbsp;Dunstan Pasterfield swept up NGC 6633 in&nbsp;binoculars and saw how large and impres-siveitwas,heimmediatelyturnedhis8-inch&nbsp;reflector to it. “It's a lovely, great, straggling&nbsp;thing...ofanabsurd shape,” Pasterfield&nbsp;writes.“Ikeepmyeyeonitannually.I'mcon-vinced that some day something will happen in <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">my</span><span class="font19"> cluster.” [Emphasis mine.]</span></p>

His eyes were of the&nbsp;blue of the forget-me-not, and of a profound melancholy, save when he was plunging his hook into you, at which time two&nbsp;red spots appeared in them and lit them up&nbsp;horribly.”</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;padding:0pt 0pt 3pt 0pt;">NGC 6633's true dimensions are hard to determine visually because vast wings of&nbsp;starlight extend outward from the “hook” to&nbsp;the north, west, and east, making the cluster appear twice as large as it truly is. Seen&nbsp;with these wings, the cluster also looks like&nbsp;a flying squirrel. Seen in another way, I have&nbsp;also called NGC 6633 the Wasp-Waist Cluster, for the thin shaft of the hook can also&nbsp;be imagined as the narrow waist of a wasp,&nbsp;whose wings are formed bythe perpendicular row of stars at the cluster's northeast end;&nbsp;the wasp's bulbous abdomen is marked by&nbsp;the southwestern ellipse; the wasp's stinger&nbsp;is the row of 10th-magnitude suns that lead</p></td></tr></table><hr>

While NGC 6633 incrementally loses&nbsp;its splendor with increasing magnification,&nbsp;be sure to examine the “wasp's” abdomen&nbsp;and stinger stars at high power; there are&nbsp;several fine pairs of stars worthy of attention. Most noteworthy, is a 5<span class="font2"><sup>^</sup> </span><span class="font19">-long, elongated gathering of eight stars at the southwest tip of the wasp's abdomen, and an even&nbsp;smaller mini-cluster of eight suns 7</span><span class="font2"><sup>^</sup> </span><span class="font19">due&nbsp;west of the wasp's abdomen.

Nearly 15</span><span class="font2"><sup>^</sup> </span><span class="font19">northeast&nbsp;of the 6th-magnitude stinger star is the red&nbsp;long-period variable T Ser.

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Like NGC 6633, IC 4756 is a superb binocular object, oneso giddy with starlight that it has been called the Summer Beehive. In the&nbsp;4-inch at 23<span class="font5">×</span><span class="font19">, IC 4756 matches NGC 6633&nbsp;in splendor. What it lacks in concentration&nbsp;it makes up in number. While NGC 6633 has&nbsp;only about 160 known members, IC 4756&nbsp;has more than three times as many. At first&nbsp;glance, IC 4756 appears as a large, sprawling&nbsp;swarm of homogeneous starlight, scattered&nbsp;across the field like the slivers of aluminum&nbsp;that fall to the floor from the action of a&nbsp;lathe. But take the time to sit back and&nbsp;relax. With time, you'll see order among&nbsp;the chaos. For instance, I see the brightest&nbsp;suns forming an elongated mass oriented&nbsp;northeast–southwest. Weak spirals of&nbsp;starlight seem to extend from this central&nbsp;bar. Two arms on the north side of the&nbsp;cluster appear to be rotating in a counterclockwise direction, while two arms in&nbsp;the southern side appear to be rotating in&nbsp;the opposite direction. At 72</span><span class="font5">×</span><span class="font19">, the cluster&nbsp;splinters into all manner of geometrical&nbsp;shapes, including a hook of multiple suns&nbsp;at the core. The cluster contains numerous&nbsp;mini-asterisms, which are best left to you to&nbsp;label. It is a veritable alphabet soup – with&nbsp;Os, Ws, Ts, Ls, Cs, Us, Vs, and Ys of starlight.&nbsp;It looks almost as if the cluster had failed&nbsp;to congeal and is slowly drifting apart like&nbsp;ashes in the wind. Use low power to trace&nbsp;out the faint extensions of stars that form&nbsp;the spirals, and be sure to take the time to&nbsp;let your imagination fly.</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">By the way, observers who own a late edition of Rev. T. W.

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">The 7th-magnitude cluster is easily visible in 7 <span class="font5">× </span><span class="font19">50 binoculars; with a steady hand, and a lot of time looking, you can&nbsp;partially resolve it. Telescopically, as the&nbsp;Rev. Thomas W.

It curves gently from the north-northwest to the southsouthwest, becoming gradually fainter in&nbsp;the same direction, until it branches into</p><img src="Hidden Treasures_files/Hidden Treasures-423.jpg" style="width:185pt;height:228pt;"/></td></tr></table><hr>

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;">another pair of legs. The cluster's core is not completely hollow, there is a dim equilateral triangle of suns near the cluster's heart.&nbsp;Seen together, all these forms look like the&nbsp;head, neck, legs, and torso of a horse. Add&nbsp;theinverted “V” of stars immediately northwest of the bright triangle and you have a&nbsp;small wing emerging from a horse's back.&nbsp;And a bright star northwest of the gentle&nbsp;curve in the west part of the cluster looks&nbsp;like a sharp horn jutting from a horse's head,&nbsp;making the entire cluster look, with imagination, like a flying unicorn, thus the name I&nbsp;have given it. The cluster's perimeter is also&nbsp;flanked by delicate chains or wispy strings of&nbsp;stars, which, seen another way, makes the&nbsp;whole mish-mashed array look like a tangle of Christmas tree lights just taken out of&nbsp;storage.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">VirtuallyeverywhereI look at higher powers I see doubles and tiny clusterings of dim suns – which could be background suns&nbsp;in the star cloud. Indeed, NGC 6709 is a&nbsp;treasure trove of multiple star systems, and&nbsp;one could easily spend an evening with this&nbsp;object, surveying it for new groups at different magnifications. The star systems I&nbsp;see at low power are easily lost to the dou-blesIseeat moderate magnifications, which&nbsp;are lost to those dim and elusive ones visible at higher magnifications. I cannot think&nbsp;of another open cluster with this alluring&nbsp;power; like the gingerbread house in the&nbsp;fairy tale “Hansel and Gretel,” NGC 6709's&nbsp;tight multiple systems have the ability to&nbsp;draw the curious viewer in . . . closer and&nbsp;closer, until they cannot help but visually&nbsp;“nibble, nibble, gnaw.”</p></td>

It lies&nbsp;immediately southwest of Aquila, east of&nbsp;Serpens Cauda, and north of Sagittarius.&nbsp;The Milky Way rushes right through it.&nbsp;The Shield represents the Coat of Arms of&nbsp;the third John Sobieski, King of Poland.&nbsp;This brave defender of his homeland so&nbsp;successfully resisted an army of invading&nbsp;Turks in 1683 that a grateful priest praised&nbsp;him during church service as a “man sent&nbsp;from God.” Interestingly, the constellation,&nbsp;in part, has long been known to Chinese&nbsp;skywatchers as <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Tien Pien,</span><span class="font19"> the Heavenly&nbsp;Casque – a divine piece of armor.</span></p></td>

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Without question, Scutum is one of my favorite constellations, for no other reason&nbsp;than that its dense star clouds hold my&nbsp;attention more than any other in the sky.&nbsp;Beyond the highly observed open clusters&nbsp;M11 and M26, I mainly enjoy seeing how&nbsp;the region's bright and dark nebulae play&nbsp;with the pale green shimmer of the Great&nbsp;Scutum Star Cloud, Barnard's Gem of the&nbsp;Milky Way.

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">NGC 6712 is a relatively small (64 light-years) and sparse (<span class="font5">∼</span><span class="font19">1 million suns) globular cluster located in our galaxy's halo about 11,400 light-years from the galactic center.

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;">very deeply into the galactic bulge, venturing to within 1,000 light-years of the galactic center. NGC 6712 is thought to have crossed through the crowded galactic plane&nbsp;only a few million years ago. Each passage&nbsp;not only robs low-mass stars from the cluster (because they tend to lie at the cluster's&nbsp;periphery) but also stretches out the cluster&nbsp;like a comet's tail.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">To find NGC 6712, first locate 4th-magnitude Alpha (<span class="font5">^</span><span class="font19">) Scuti, which lies on the southwest edge of the Scutum Star Cloud,&nbsp;about 2 </span><span class="font17"><sub>2</sub><sup>1 </sup></span><span class="font2"><sup>◦</sup> </span><span class="font19">northwest of M26.

I can't see any central&nbsp;concentration – no bright stellar pip, just&nbsp;a mantle and an outer halo. At the core,&nbsp;however, there appears to be a hollow surrounded by arcs of dense clumps of starlight.&nbsp;With averted vision the southeast flank of&nbsp;the mantle has two bright arms forming a&nbsp;“V.” Other feathery arms spiral off to the&nbsp;north, west, south, and east. The mantle's&nbsp;northwest edge is capped by stars. And the&nbsp;outer halo, the one being stripped of stars&nbsp;that jitter about in the wavering sea like&nbsp;flecks on coffee. Arizona amateur Andrew&nbsp;Cooper observed NGC 6712 through an 18-inch f/4.5 reflector at 174</span><span class="font5">× </span><span class="font19">and saw the cluster fully resolved.

If you see it, take a breath, walk&nbsp;away from the telescope, and return to the&nbsp;eyepiece, when you feel refreshed. Now, see&nbsp;if you can see not only dark (black) nebulosity but also gray. After enjoying these ribbons&nbsp;of darkness, return your gaze to our original&nbsp;target, NGC 6712, which should now look&nbsp;like a castaway on a beach of starlight, onto&nbsp;which the dark nebulosity washes like dark&nbsp;waves at night.</span></p></td></tr></table><hr><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"><img src="Hidden Treasures_files/Hidden Treasures-428.jpg" style="width:389pt;height:512pt;"/></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;">

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;">Although NGC 6723 appears very close to the vast swath of&nbsp;obscuring matter associated&nbsp;with the Corona Australis&nbsp;molecular cloud, it is seen&nbsp;through a relatively transparent window of sky. It&nbsp;is a moderate-sized globular spanning some 108 light-years of space.

Each of the cluster's stars contain, on average, about <span class="font17"><sub>1</sub><sup>1</sup><sub>0</sub> </span><span class="font19">to </span><span class="font17"><sub>1</sub><sup>1</sup><sub>6</sub> </span><span class="font19">as much&nbsp;iron (per unit hydrogen) as does our Sun.&nbsp;The amount of iron present in globular clusters ranges between 0.1 and 0.03 of the&nbsp;solar value.

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">L. K. Fullton and B. W. Carney (University of North Carolina), used NGC 6723 as part&nbsp;of their study of globular clusters near the&nbsp;galactic center – to probe the formation history and chemical evolution of the galaxy's&nbsp;central regions out to 15,000 light-years.&nbsp;While NGC 6723 lies 28,000 light-years from&nbsp;the Sun, it is only 8,500 light-years from the&nbsp;galactic center, making it a perfect candidate for this study. The researchers found&nbsp;that the age and metallicity of NGC 6723 is&nbsp;similar to that of RR Lyrae stars found in the&nbsp;galacticbulge,suggestingthatthebulge'sRR&nbsp;Lyrae stars are at least as old as the oldest&nbsp;globular star clusters. If the bulge's RR Lyrae&nbsp;stars and NGC 6723 represent the first stages&nbsp;of bulge formation, then this result suggests&nbsp;that our galaxy's bulge required some 8 billion years to form.</p>

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Shining at 7th magnitude, the cluster is a tad faint to be detected with the unaided&nbsp;eye, but it is so concentrated that someone&nbsp;with young eyes should consider taking up&nbsp;the challenge, especially if attending one of&nbsp;the more southerly star parties, such as the&nbsp;Texas Star Party. Needless to say the object is&nbsp;a cinch in 7 <span class="font5">× </span><span class="font19">50 binoculars and a fine sight&nbsp;in the smallest of telescopes. In my antique&nbsp;telescope, NGC 6723 begins to show structure, namely a bright core surrounded by an&nbsp;irregular and mottled halo of diffuse light.&nbsp;The cluster's brightest star shines at magnitude 12.8 and its horizontal branch magnitude is only 15.5.

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">At 72<span class="font5">×</span><span class="font19">, the cluster turns to grains of salt and pepper. Indeed, with averted vision, the&nbsp;cluster is a sizzling haze of stars in three distinct layers: a globular core, an inner halo,&nbsp;and an outer aureole. Many of NGC 6723's&nbsp;outlying stars resolve into a web of blue-tinted starlight, while the core looks particularly frothy. It is asif some divine artisttried&nbsp;to depict these words of the nineteenthcentury American poet William Hamilton&nbsp;Hayne: “Pure leagues of stars from garish&nbsp;light withdrawn / Behind celestial lace-work&nbsp;pale as foam.” With any concentration the&nbsp;southern fringes of the cluster's halo fracture into long fingers of light, especially to&nbsp;the south, where four strong strings of stars&nbsp;radiate from a bright wedge of light at the&nbsp;core. Another prominent finger extends to&nbsp;the northeast and a few stubby nubs can&nbsp;be seen to the northwest. Overall, the cluster's southern side is brighter than the north.&nbsp;Ernst Hartung saw similar features, calling&nbsp;NGC 6723 “irregularly round and looking&nbsp;like an almost hemispherical heap of star&nbsp;dust, the outliers extending to 4</span><span class="font2"><sup>^</sup> </span><span class="font19">across, and&nbsp;being in irregular rays.”</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">At high power, NGC 6723 looks like a blizzard of starlight. Look for dark lanes running through its core and fringes. One prominent lane lies just northwest of the inner&nbsp;core and is oriented northeast–southwest.&nbsp;It looks like the wound from a cat scratch.&nbsp;Now return to low power and just gaze&nbsp;at the cluster without concentrating. Just&nbsp;let the object's light settle on your eye.&nbsp;Isn't there something extremely elegant&nbsp;about this cluster? It has a delicate sheen&nbsp;to it, one that softens its silent majesty.&nbsp;NGC 6723 stands before the eye like a&nbsp;weathered mountain in the mist, aged yet&nbsp;beautiful, catching the last rays of Sun.&nbsp;It's a reminder that, like an old, cherished photograph, beauty does not wither&nbsp;with age.</p></td></tr></table><hr><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"><img src="Hidden Treasures_files/Hidden Treasures-432.jpg" style="width:389pt;height:512pt;"/></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all">

But in a 1970 publication&nbsp;of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific,&nbsp;Douglas S.

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Although it ispart of the visible naked-eye sky, the group was first singled out by the&nbsp;Persian astronomer Al-Sufi (ad 903–986)<a name="footnote10"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark224">10</a></sup><span class="font17"><sup>&nbsp;</sup></span><span class="font19">who included it in his </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">The Book of the Fixed&nbsp;Stars</span><span class="font19"> (circa 964). A French translation by&nbsp;H. C. F. C. Schjellerup published at St.&nbsp;Petersburg in 1874, says that he called the&nbsp;group “a little cloud [or cloudy patch] situated to the north of the two stars of the&nbsp;notch of Sagitta.” Al-Sufi's discovery was not&nbsp;widely known until the late Kenneth Glyn&nbsp;Jones published his 1975 </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">The Search for the&nbsp;Nebulae.</span></p></td>
<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Several others have staked independent discovery claims. Chief among them was&nbsp;Giovanni Batista Hodierna (1597–1660),&nbsp;whose observation of it appeared in his&nbsp;<span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">De Admirandi Coeli Caracteribus</span><span class="font19"> – a catalog, published in 1654, of some 40 deepsky objects, of which at least 19 are real&nbsp;AAVSO charts for variable stars, later independently discovered this grouping at some&nbsp;point during the 1920s or 1930s. Archinal&nbsp;andHynes,however,couldnotfindanypub-lication that explains the circumstances or&nbsp;date of Brocchi's discovery, though he did&nbsp;create a map of the object for use in calibrating photometers. For this reason, his name&nbsp;has long been associated with the group,&nbsp;being referred to as the now erroneous Broc-chi's Cluster. The most commonly used and&nbsp;recognized name for the asterism, however, is Collinder 399, based on Per Arne&nbsp;Collinder's yet one more possible independent discovery, which he lists in his 1931 </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">On&nbsp;Structured Properties of Open Galactic Clusters and Their Spatial Distribution</span><span class="font19">.</span></p>

Be sure to spend some time scrutinizing this sparkling&nbsp;cloud, because five of the stars are between&nbsp;magnitude 5.2 and 6.3, and seven of them&nbsp;are brighter than 7th magnitude (see the&nbsp;chart above). I have seen the five brightest with effort and have suspected a sixth.&nbsp;The more time I take, the more distinct the&nbsp;stars appear. Make sure you are relaxed and&nbsp;comfortable,try lying supine on a blanket or&nbsp;recliner. Take breaks and be sure to breathe;&nbsp;inhale several times after each break before&nbsp;you start anew. It could take up to a half hour&nbsp;to achieve success. Of course, there is nothing like seeing the Coathanger in binoculars.&nbsp;AsE. E. Barnard described in 1927, it is “a fine&nbsp;group of five bright stars equally distant in&nbsp;a straight line east and west . . . With two&nbsp;others to the south they make a remarkable&nbsp;figure.” Of course, the two stars to the south&nbsp;are part of the distinct hook that describes&nbsp;the center row being centered on 4 and 5&nbsp;Vulpeculae. In fact, if you just relax, the&nbsp;entire asterism seems to be comprised of&nbsp;parallel rows of stars in typical escheresque&nbsp;visual confusion – just look and you will see.&nbsp;The magnitude 5.6 star 10<span class="font2"><sup>^</sup> </span><span class="font19">southeast of the&nbsp;midpoint between 4and5 Vulpeculae in the&nbsp;Coathanger's hook is a nice telescopic double with a 10th-magnitude companion to&nbsp;the northeast.

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;">ngc 6819 is a little and lonely open cluster located near the galactic plane&nbsp;in the vast Cygnus Milky Way. If that sounds&nbsp;like a paradox, it isn't. Not every object in&nbsp;the Milky Way stands out like a bursting&nbsp;firecracker. The fact is, NGC 6819 is just far&nbsp;enough away from the main stream of the&nbsp;celestial Mardi Gras parading through the&nbsp;long axis of the Northern Cross that it is as&nbsp;inconspicuous as a butterfly fluttering in a&nbsp;field near a busy highway.</p></td>
<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">It has long been wondered how so bright and tight an object escaped the gaze of&nbsp;William Herschel in his grand survey of the&nbsp;heavens. But it didn't: thanks to research&nbsp;done by Michael Hoskin and Owen Gingerich, we find that William's sister, Caroline, discovered the cluster on May 12,&nbsp;1784, “halfway between delta Cyg &amp; eta&nbsp;&amp; theta Lyrae making an isosceles triangle&nbsp;downwards when in that situation.” William&nbsp;reviewed it in detail on December 31, 1801.&nbsp;But, as Hoskin explains, “[t]his cluster was&nbsp;reobserved by William after 1790 when he&nbsp;established the existence of ‘true' nebulosity and so had lost interest in clusters.”</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">GermanastronomerKarl Ludwig Harding (1765–1834) independently found it sometime between 1820 and 1824 – probably&nbsp;with a 4-inch refractor at Go¨ ttingen Observatory, though that fact is uncertain. He&nbsp;listed it in the 1827 <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Berliner Jahrbuch</span><span class="font19"> along&nbsp;with another of his discoveries – planetary nebula NGC 7293 (Caldwell 63), the&nbsp;famous Helix Nebula in Aquarius – sometime between 1820 and 1824. Harding, however, is best known for his discovery of the&nbsp;asteroid 3 Juno on September 1, 1804; at the&nbsp;time he was employed. He also discovered&nbsp;three comets and published the </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Atlas novus&nbsp;coelestis</span><span class="font19"> which cataloged 120,000 stars.</span></p></td></tr></table><hr>

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">NGC 6819 is a highly concentrated and rich cluster with stars of nearly uniform&nbsp;magnitude.

They also found the&nbsp;cluster to be dynamically relaxed, meaning&nbsp;that its high-mass stars (giants and upper&nbsp;main-sequence stars) tend to sink to the&nbsp;inner region while low-mass stars (lower&nbsp;main-sequence stars) tend&nbsp;to occupy the outer regions,&nbsp;though it appears that a large&nbsp;number of these low-mass&nbsp;stars has escaped from the&nbsp;cluster.</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">There has been another advance in knowledge: early&nbsp;photometric studies of NGC&nbsp;6819 indicate that it is an&nbsp;old open cluster, similar to&nbsp;M67 (<span class="font5">∼</span><span class="font19">4 or 5 billion years&nbsp;old), but recent estimates&nbsp;show its age at about 2.5&nbsp;billion years, making it an&nbsp;intermediate-age, not an old,&nbsp;cluster.

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">K. T. Hole (University of Wisconsin, Madison) and his colleagues at the 2003 American Astronomical Society Meeting presented results of a radial-velocity study of NGC 6819, in which they determined 5,140&nbsp;measurements of 1,140 stars, obtained over&nbsp;the course of some 5 years with the WIYN&nbsp;Multiple-Object Spectrograph.

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">NGC 6819 is indeed a true hidden treasure in a very lonely part of Cygnus. It is visible in both 7 <span class="font5">× </span><span class="font19">50 binoculars – if you&nbsp;know exactly where to look; my antique telescope shows it much the same. At23</span><span class="font5">×</span><span class="font19">in the&nbsp;4-inch, the cluster looks like a condensed&nbsp;globe of starlight, like a globular cluster, so&nbsp;it is no surprise that Lund would have mistaken it for one of these more distant and&nbsp;older objects. With little effort, prominent&nbsp;streams and clumps of stars can be seen&nbsp;or traced within it. A lazy V-shaped pattern&nbsp;of stars is emblazoned on the diffuse background of dimmer suns, as if burned there&nbsp;with a hot branding iron. One arm of the V&nbsp;extends to the north, the other to the northwest. The longer I look, the more I see the&nbsp;apex of the “V” branch out to the southeast&nbsp;and the southwest, forming a weak Greek&nbsp;letter </span><span class="font5">^ </span><span class="font19">.</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">At low powers Skiff and Luginbuhl call it granular, and this is an excellent description, since it really is a globe of dim stellar&nbsp;“noise,” like TV static. It also lies in a rich&nbsp;Milky Way field – a glorious sight, really, at&nbsp;low power. Increasing magnification brings&nbsp;out the “V” and diminishes the impression&nbsp;of granularity. It also brings out a knot of&nbsp;dim suns around a prominent double near&nbsp;the southern apex of the “V” in the eastern&nbsp;arm. Another double appears midway in the&nbsp;western arm, which is comprised of about&nbsp;six stars.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Another mini-cluster lies midway in the eastern arm directly opposite the double&nbsp;in the western arm. It's a “Z” of similarly&nbsp;bright suns. There's a very challenging double for a 4-inch under moderate viewing&nbsp;conditions. The southern knot is also part&nbsp;of a longer complex oriented southeast–&nbsp;northwest. The <span class="font5">^ </span><span class="font19">asterism, under low magnifications, has angular extensions giving&nbsp;the cluster a spiral shape. So, it's sort of like&nbsp;an octopus. The southern double is its eyes&nbsp;and the oval to the southwest is its head.</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Interestingly, in the Webb Society's <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">DeepSky Observer's Handbook</span><span class="font19"> ( Volume 3), Guy Hurst describes the brightest portions in a&nbsp;10-inch telescope at 120</span><span class="font5">× </span><span class="font19">as being “roughly&nbsp;U-shaped,” which is a lazy “V,” with resolved&nbsp;stars of 11th to 13th magnitude “set against&nbsp;unresolved nebulosity.” No doubt, this nebulosity is unresolved Milky Way.</span></p></td></tr></table><hr><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"><img src="Hidden Treasures_files/Hidden Treasures-441.jpg" style="width:389pt;height:512pt;"/></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;">

(Note that NGC 6445 [Hidden&nbsp;Treasure 84] is sometimes mistakenly&nbsp;referred to as the Little Gem, but this is&nbsp;an error propagated by a mistake in <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Sky&nbsp;Catalogue 2000.0</span><span class="font19">, Volume 2.)

The Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images showed the nebula as having a roughly spherical outer envelope as&nbsp;well as a brighter vase-shaped interior “bubble.” The scientists believe that a fast wind&nbsp;from the hot central star is creating the elongated vase shape and, in fact, has caused&nbsp;a “blowout” at the two ends of the major&nbsp;axis.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Italian astronomer S. Benetti (Astronomical Observatory of Padova), and colleagues elaborated on NGC 6818's threedimensional structure in a 2003 <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Astronomy and Astrophysics</span><span class="font19"> paper. The Little Gem appears to be a young (3,500 years), optically thin double-shell nebula seen almost&nbsp;equatorial on, with a tenuous and patchy&nbsp;spherical envelope (0.6 light-years across)&nbsp;encircling a dense and inhomogeneous tri-axial ellipsoid with a hole along the major&nbsp;axis and a pair of equatorial, thick “moustaches.”</span></p></td>
<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">The central star, which has a mass of about 0.6 Sun, is faint, shining around 17th&nbsp;magnitude. In a 1999 <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Astrophyiscal Journal&nbsp;</span><span class="font19">paper, Seik Hyung and Lawrence H. Aller&nbsp;(University of California, Los Angeles) and&nbsp;Walter A. Fieibelman (NASA-Goddard Space&nbsp;Flight Center) note that the star's spectrum&nbsp;reveals that it may be a Wolf-Rayet type. It&nbsp;has a luminosity of about 3,500 Suns and&nbsp;a temperature of at least 140,000 K, suggesting an age of 9,000 years. And while&nbsp;NGC 6818's spectrum showed carbon and&nbsp;nitrogen appearing more abundant than&nbsp;in the Sun, other elements seem to have&nbsp;roughly a solar abundance. NGC 6818 may,&nbsp;then,haveoriginatedfromastarresembling&nbsp;the Sun, at least in chemical composition.</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">NGC 6818 is at the start of what's known as the recombination phase, whereby electrons are being captured by protons following a luminosity decline of the central star,&nbsp;which is rapidly moving toward becoming&nbsp;a white dwarf. The nebula is destined to&nbsp;become thicker and thicker, with an increasing fraction of neutral, dusty gas in the outermost layers.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">The exciting star of NGC 6818 is also a visual binary: a faint, red companion of&nbsp;about magnitude 17.7 appears at 0.09<span class="font2"><sup>^^</sup> </span><span class="font19">in&nbsp;position angle 190</span><span class="font2"><sup>◦</sup></span><span class="font19">, corresponding to asep-aration of about 150 astronomical units and&nbsp;to an orbital period of 1,500 years.</span></p>

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;">ngc 6866 is a marvelously obscure, but visually enticing, cluster&nbsp;that Caroline Herschel discovered on the&nbsp;evening of July 23, 1783.

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">“Some small stars; or perhaps a Nebula. My Brother put, I believe, a power of 70 to&nbsp;the Sweeper, then what is call'd some small&nbsp;stars are about a hundred or more.” Caroline&nbsp;saw the object again on October 16, 1783.&nbsp;“My Brother shewed me the spot in Cygnus,&nbsp;which I saw first July 23rd,” she writes&nbsp;“the stars very numerous, and intermixed&nbsp;with strong nebulosity. Mess[ier] has it&nbsp;not.”</p></td>

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">The identity of this cluster is undeniably certain, for Hoskin also found the following description of the cluster in William&nbsp;Herschel's journal for the evening of October 16, 1783: “Cluster of stars making&nbsp;an isosceles triangle with delta &amp; omi-cron Cygni, the vertex laying S following;&nbsp;about 3 or 4 degrees from delta or omi-cron. It contains very great variety of&nbsp;magnitudes; the large ones are scattered&nbsp;the smaller stars being mixed between&nbsp;them. 7ft [reflector] compound [eyepiece]&nbsp;– Lina [i.e. Caroline].” William's closing&nbsp;remark, “Lina” was his affectionate way of&nbsp;stating that Caroline had discovered this&nbsp;object, not him.

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;">When you hear deep-sky observers mention the constellation&nbsp;Vulpecula, the Little Fox, it is usually in&nbsp;connection with either the spectacular&nbsp;planetary nebula M27 (the Dumbbell Nebula), the Coathanger asterism (Collinder 399&nbsp;[Hidden Treasure 97]), or the mysterious&nbsp;open cluster NGC 6885 (Caldwell 37).&nbsp;Vulpecula is also home to another visual&nbsp;gem, NGC 6940, a most abundant star&nbsp;cluster in the southern branch of the Milky&nbsp;Way bordering the Great Rift. But it is&nbsp;largely ignored. You'll find it lost in the void&nbsp;between the southern wingtip of Cygnus&nbsp;and the Little Fox's hind quarters. It is a&nbsp;binocular treat and a telescopic wonder&nbsp;of stellar riches – one whose variety and&nbsp;multitude almost defies imagining.</p></td>
<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">But first a word about Vulpecula. The original name of the constellation is <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Vulpecula cum Ansere,</span><span class="font19"> meaning the Little Fox (Vulpecula) with the Goose (Ansere). Johannes&nbsp;Hevelius created it to occupy a space&nbsp;between Sagitta, the Arrow, and Cygnus, the&nbsp;Swan. As Hevelius said, “I wished to place&nbsp;a fox with a goose in the space of the sky&nbsp;well fitted to it; because such an animal is&nbsp;very cunning, voracious, and fierce. Aquila&nbsp;and Vultur areof the same nature, rapacious&nbsp;and greedy.”</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Alas, Ansere, the Goose has disappeared from the constellation's title – probably a&nbsp;response to our ever increasing need for&nbsp;an economy of words (our fast-paced world&nbsp;spawns short attention spans), or as Patrick&nbsp;Caldwell-Moore jibes in the 1968 edition&nbsp;of his book <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Amateur Astronomy</span><span class="font19">, “possibly&nbsp;the fox has eaten it.” Ironically, there is no&nbsp;known mythology related to the fox, but one&nbsp;German myth describes how Antenteh and</span></p></td></tr></table><hr><div style="float:left;layout-flow:horizontal;"><img src="Hidden Treasures_files/Hidden Treasures-451.jpg" style="width:256pt;height:266pt;"/></div>

Since Hevelius&nbsp;intended Vulpecula to have a Goose, why&nbsp;not return it to the sky, so that its feathers and down can warm the hearts of those&nbsp;just learning the sky. Like some mythological god, the power to grant this request lies&nbsp;within you. There is another reason to bring&nbsp;back the Goose.

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;">G. Tagliaferri (Astronomical Observatory of Brera) used the now defunct ROSAT satellite&nbsp;to study coronal activity in the stars of NGC&nbsp;6940. Coronal activity in stars depends crucially on stellar rotation, which decreases&nbsp;with age due to magnetic breaking. Clusters&nbsp;with ages greater than 1 billion years are not&nbsp;expected to contain rapidly rotating late-type stars. ROSAT data show that stellar&nbsp;coronal activity still exists in NGC 6940, but&nbsp;it is confined to known late-type stars in&nbsp;binarysystems.Therefore,BelloniandTagli-aferrideterminedthatNGC6940hasanesti-mated age of about 1 billion years, placing&nbsp;it at the threshold of coronal inactivity.</p></td>

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">NGC 6940 is quite stunning in small telescopes under a dark sky. At 23<span class="font5">× </span><span class="font19">in the 4-inch, the cluster is at its best –&nbsp;a highly elliptical body of&nbsp;shimmering lights with many&nbsp;star clumps that give off a&nbsp;rich, mottled glow. A bright&nbsp;pair of stars lies just west&nbsp;of the cluster's heart; the&nbsp;brightest member is the&nbsp;semi-regular variable star FG&nbsp;Vulpeculae, which varies in&nbsp;brightness from magnitude&nbsp;9.0 to 9.5 every 80 days. FG&nbsp;Vul has a warm orange hue,&nbsp;like that of the setting Sun,&nbsp;which is in stark contrast&nbsp;to the cool aquamarine&nbsp;hue of its companion. The&nbsp;rest of the cluster's stars&nbsp;are scatted across the field&nbsp;like diamond dust in a strong&nbsp;and erratic wind. Indeed, the&nbsp;cluster's core is splintered&nbsp;into three highly elongated&nbsp;groups, as if carried aloft by&nbsp;a jet stream. The cluster's&nbsp;core is marked by a long and narrow vein of&nbsp;stars running northwest–southeast immediately northeast of FG Vul. The brightest&nbsp;section of the core lies to the northeast and&nbsp;is a dense elliptical clutch of suns, oriented&nbsp;east–west. The third section of the core is an&nbsp;elongated crowd of stars extending southeast of FG Vulpeculae. Two elongated bands&nbsp;of darkness separate these groups. So the&nbsp;core of NGC 6940 is an incredibly busy and&nbsp;complex gathering of mini-clusters, whose&nbsp;overall shape (seen with north up) forms a&nbsp;backward epsilon (</span><span class="font5">^</span><span class="font19">).</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">The cluster is rich, having some 170 members, which are, in addition, projected&nbsp;against a rich Milky Way background, so it&nbsp;is most exhausting to observe. There is so&nbsp;much to see, so much to imagine. Increase&nbsp;magnification and more background stars&nbsp;can be seen. More and more pairings and&nbsp;groupings – lots of doubles and triples and&nbsp;quintuplets. With averted vision it's like seeing layer upon layer of clusters whose combined light measures nearly a full Moon&nbsp;diameter across.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">The cluster's outlying regions contain two looping arcs like insect wings; one wing lies&nbsp;to the northeast, the other to the southwest of the elliptical core. A forked string&nbsp;of stars flaring to the northwest forms the&nbsp;insect's tail. With imagination the cluster looks like Mothra, that classic 1960s&nbsp;Japanese science-fiction creature – a mothlike goddess who spends eternity seeking a&nbsp;path to peace. The double star near the cluster's center, on the giant Moth's back, is, of&nbsp;course, the tiny telepathic twin princesses&nbsp;who ride the back of Mothra and sing pleas&nbsp;to their goddess whenever they need help.</p></td></tr></table><hr><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"><img src="Hidden Treasures_files/Hidden Treasures-454.jpg" style="width:389pt;height:512pt;"/></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;">

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Part of the problem may be that any dark nebula visible to the naked eye was, at one&nbsp;time, called a “Coalsack.” The name was created by the bold mariners who sailed the&nbsp;southern seas centuries ago. The first void&nbsp;to be named was the Coalsack next to the&nbsp;Southern Cross, and it was looked upon&nbsp;with superstitious wonder.<a name="footnote11"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark235">11</a></sup><span class="font17"><sup></sup> </span><span class="font19">This dark cloud,&nbsp;sailors believed, possessed some occult connection with the Cross, so whenever they&nbsp;chanced upon it, they would “cross themselves” and “shudder.” Little wonder then&nbsp;that the first Coalsack to draw astronomers'&nbsp;attention in the Northern Hemisphere was&nbsp;that deep, dark “shadow” of the Northern&nbsp;Cross.</span></p></td></tr></table><hr>

<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">If you're wondering where this “dark opening” might be, do not fear, its position has been dutifully recorded by several&nbsp;astronomy popularizers over the last cen-turyand more. In the 1923 edition of <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Astronomy with an Opera Glass</span><span class="font19"> (first published&nbsp;in 1888), Garret P. Serviss includes this passage in his discussion of Cygnus the Swan:&nbsp;“Between the stars (</span><span class="font5">^</span><span class="font19">), (</span><span class="font5">^</span><span class="font19">), (</span><span class="font3">ε</span><span class="font19">), is the strange&nbsp;dark gap in the galaxy called the Coal-Sack,&nbsp;a sort of hole in the starry heavens. Although&nbsp;it is not entirely empty of stars, its blackness&nbsp;is striking in contrast with the brilliancy of&nbsp;the Milky-Way in this neighborhood.” And&nbsp;William Tyler Olcott gives this description&nbsp;in his 1911 </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Star Lore of All Ages: A Collection&nbsp;of Myths, Legends, and Facts Concerning the&nbsp;Constellations of the Northern Hemisphere</span><span class="font19">:&nbsp;“Between (</span><span class="font5">^</span><span class="font19">), (</span><span class="font5">^ </span><span class="font19">), and (</span><span class="font3">ε</span><span class="font19">) Cygni is one of&nbsp;the vacant spaces in the Milky Way, a black&nbsp;and seemingly bottomless abyss, the brink&nbsp;over which man peers into the profound and&nbsp;mysterious depths of interstellar space. This&nbsp;wonderful region in the sky is known as ‘the&nbsp;Northern Coal Sack'.”</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">The reason the Northern Coalsack's identity has been a bit fuzzy of late (beside the fact that for more than a half century it has not been plotted on star charts)&nbsp;is that Cygnus harbors several naked-eye&nbsp;coalsacks; but only one of them – the one&nbsp;between Alpha, Gamma, and Epsilon – carries that proper name. The dark nebula most&nbsp;frequently mistaken for the Northern Coalsack is an intense, 5<span class="font2"><sup>◦</sup> </span><span class="font19">-wide ink spot some&nbsp;8</span><span class="font2"><sup>◦</sup> </span><span class="font19">north-northeast of Alpha Cygni (Deneb),&nbsp;close to the Cepheus border (centered at&nbsp;right ascension: 21</span><span class="font17"><sup>h</sup> </span><span class="font19">06</span><span class="font17"><sup>m</sup></span><span class="font19">; declination </span><span class="font5">+</span><span class="font19">52</span><span class="font2"><sup>◦&nbsp;</sup></span><span class="font19">30</span><span class="font2"><sup>^</sup> </span><span class="font19">).

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">I have always been fond of the Northern Coalsack. It epitomizes the great unknown.&nbsp;When I looked into its depths as a child, it&nbsp;caused my mind to stir, to awaken to a sad&nbsp;reality: that there are things in this universe&nbsp;not meant for human eyes to see. It created a sense of helplessness, knowing that&nbsp;I could never peek behind that veil. What&nbsp;wonders lie in wait? Here was an object as&nbsp;impenetrable as the rock (molten or otherwise) between Earth's core and its crust. It's&nbsp;a secret that lay hidden in a darkened room.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">This “window of absolute night,” as Serviss calls it in his 1919 book <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Curiosities of&nbsp;the Sky</span><span class="font19">, is a black mirror of infinite depth –&nbsp;something we gaze into with blank eyes&nbsp;and open minds. It is a gathering place for&nbsp;all thought and wonder. “Infinity seems to&nbsp;acquire a new meaning in the presence of&nbsp;these black openings in the sky,” Serviss&nbsp;says, “for as one continues to gaze it loses its&nbsp;purely metaphysical quality and becomes a&nbsp;kind of entity, like the ocean.” Serviss felt&nbsp;the name “coal-sacks” was hardly descriptive. “Rather,” he said, “they produce upon&nbsp;the mind the effect of blank windows in a&nbsp;lonely house on a pitch-dark night, which,&nbsp;when looked at from the brilliant interior,&nbsp;become appalling in their rayless murk.”</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Serviss notes that the Northern Coalsack is “less perfect” than the one in the south.&nbsp;“Instead of looking like an absolute void&nbsp;in the sky, it rather appears as if a canopy&nbsp;of dark gauze had been drawn over the&nbsp;stars.”</p></td></tr></table><hr>

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">We know today that there is nothing outrageously mysterious about these “voids.” They are simply cold, dusty clouds of molecular hydrogen gas that cloak or dim the light&nbsp;of whatever lurks behind them. And while&nbsp;the Northern Coalsack in Cygnus does not&nbsp;appearasdarkasitssoutherncounterpart,it&nbsp;is. In a 2003 <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Astronomical Journal</span><span class="font19"> article, A.&nbsp;Fresneau (Astronomical Observatory, Stras-bourg,France)andcolleaguesarguethatnot&nbsp;only are the Northern and Southern Coalsacks located at roughly the same distance,&nbsp;“about 160 </span><span class="font5">± </span><span class="font19">50 [parsecs] from the Sun,”&nbsp;but they are equally as dark, exceeding “the&nbsp;mean interstellar extinction by more than&nbsp;0.7 </span><span class="font5">± </span><span class="font19">0.1 [magnitude].”</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">The reason the Northern Coalsack appears less evident than the Southern&nbsp;Coalsack is a matter of contrast. The Milky&nbsp;Way surrounding the Southern Coalsack&nbsp;is one of the brightest and richest swaths&nbsp;of stars, clusters, and nebulosities in the&nbsp;heavens. The Southern Coalsack looks very&nbsp;dark because the Milky Way next to it is&nbsp;very bright. In fact, Sir John Herschel, who&nbsp;believed that the Sun was near (not at) the&nbsp;center of the Milky Way, suggested that the&nbsp;Sun was slightly closer to the south side&nbsp;of the Milky Way, considering the greater&nbsp;brightness of the stars in that direction.</p></td>
<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">The Northern Coalsack is a true hidden treasure. It has been largely “overshadowed” by the North America Nebula (Caldwell 20), which is ironic because the dark regions just west of the North America and&nbsp;Pelican Nebulae form the Northern Coalsack's eastern border. If you can get away&nbsp;from city lights in late summer and find&nbsp;the time to lay back on a blanket on a&nbsp;warm, starlit evening, the Swan will be flying&nbsp;overhead. But do not look at the stars that&nbsp;populate the Cygnus Milky Way. Instead,&nbsp;relax your eyes and focus on that magnificent gap of dark dust lying between Alpha,&nbsp;Gamma, and Epsilon Cygni. This gap forms&nbsp;the body of the Milky Way's Black Swan.&nbsp;The Swan's wings are comprised of two&nbsp;slightly less intense ellipses of darkness: one&nbsp;lies between Alpha, Gamma, and Omicron<span class="font17"><sup>1&nbsp;</sup></span><span class="font19">(o</span><span class="font17"><sup>1</sup></span><span class="font19">) Cygni (including Barnard 46), while the&nbsp;other lies to the south of the North America Nebula, between the stars Xi (</span><span class="font5">^ </span><span class="font19">), Nu (</span><span class="font5">^</span><span class="font19">),&nbsp;and Tau (</span><span class="font5">^ </span><span class="font19">) Cygni. The long neck of the&nbsp;Black Swan is the Great Cygnus Rift that&nbsp;begins just south of Gamma and follows&nbsp;the galactic equator to a point between 35&nbsp;and 39 Cygni, where you'll find the Swan's&nbsp;head.</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Many ancient cultures saw creatures in the dark nebulae, and I can understand&nbsp;why. Creatures formed by dark nebulae have&nbsp;a more three-dimensional appearance to&nbsp;them than, say, the stick figure constellations of the two-dimensional sky. Interestingly, in <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Star Names: Their Lore and Meaning</span><span class="font19">, Richard Hinckley Allen notes that while&nbsp;ancient Greek astronomers saw the stars of&nbsp;Cygnus as some kind of bird, most likely a&nbsp;hen, “Aratos described itas ‘dark,' especially&nbsp;as to its wings.” It seems then that Aratos is&nbsp;thefirstpersonknowntocallattentiontothe&nbsp;Northern Coalsack. Curiously, Hipparchos,&nbsp;believing that Aratos had made some sort of&nbsp;verbal error, “corrected” the situation.</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">The Northern Coalsack, like a petroglyph, is the dark imprint of human imagination.&nbsp;When I look at it with modern eyes, I see a&nbsp;“swallow” or “purple martin.” The question&nbsp;is what fantastic creature does your mind&nbsp;chisel out in this region?</p></td></tr></table><hr>

<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Although NGC 7027 is bright (magnitude 8.5), it avoided detection until 1878 when the renowned French astronomer&nbsp;Edouard Jean-Marie Stephan (1837–1923)&nbsp;spied it with the 31-inch reflector at Marseille Observatory – one of the first large&nbsp;reflectors to use a silvered-glass mirror.&nbsp;NGC 7027 was one of many new nebulae&nbsp;Stephan discovered with that instrument&nbsp;(see Hidden Treasure 35). Alas, despite all&nbsp;of the attention NGC 7027 receives in the&nbsp;professional community, it is one of the&nbsp;least observed planetaries in amateur circles. And while NGC 7027 is so bright that it&nbsp;can be spied in an opera glass (if one knows&nbsp;where to look), amateurs are more eager&nbsp;to seek out Stephan's most popular find:&nbsp;Stephan's Quintet (Arp 319) –agaggleoffive&nbsp;dim galaxies about <span class="font17"><sub>2</sub><sup>1 </sup></span><span class="font2"><sup>◦</sup> </span><span class="font19">south-southwest of&nbsp;the stunning spiral system NGC 7331 (Caldwell 30) in Pegasus.</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Actually, Stephan's discovery of NGC 7027 is a bit ironic. In 1873–1874, Stephan had&nbsp;used the 31-inch reflector at Marseille in&nbsp;the first attempt to measure the apparent&nbsp;diameter of stars. Although he was unsuccessful (he could only prove that they were&nbsp;smaller than 0.16<span class="font2"><sup>^^</sup> </span><span class="font19">), his later discovery of&nbsp;NGC 7027, proved to be, in fact, that of&nbsp;a star's outer atmosphere, which is indeed&nbsp;measurable.

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">The Rev. Thomas W. Webb – whose classic handbook, <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Celestial Objects for Common Telescopes</span><span class="font19">, is to this day a handy reference&nbsp;guide for amateur astronomers – independently discovered NGC 7027 on November&nbsp;14, 1879: “Planetary, like a [magnitude] 8.5&nbsp;star, about 4</span><span class="font2"><sup>^^</sup> </span><span class="font19">, found by me independently.”&nbsp;This discovery is quite remarkable, since&nbsp;Webb notes that “I had at one time projected a survey of the wonders of [Cygnus]&nbsp;with a sweeping power; but want of leisure,&nbsp;an unsuitable mounting, and the astonishing profusion of magnificence, combined&nbsp;to render a task hopeless for me which,&nbsp;I trust, may be carried through by some&nbsp;future observer.” Even he was not aware of&nbsp;what a wonder he discovered. His calling&nbsp;it a “planetary nebula” had no astrophysical understanding behind it. He was simply&nbsp;classifying it in the same manner of William&nbsp;Herschel before him. What he classified was&nbsp;simply a round nebula shaped like a planet.</span></p></td>
<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Peter Collins, one of the world's greatest visual nova discoverers, introduced me to&nbsp;NGC 7027, in the early 1970s. He showed&nbsp;it to me through the 9-inch f/12 Clark&nbsp;refractor at Harvard College Observatory&nbsp;in Cambridge, Massachusetts. At the time,&nbsp;astronomers were just beginning to understand the nature of this enigmatic beast.&nbsp;A decade earlier, astronomers had begun&nbsp;using radio telescopes to study planetary&nbsp;nebulae, which turned out to be powerful&nbsp;radio sources, and NGC 7027 was one of the&nbsp;brightest. NGC 7027's radio emissions were&nbsp;so intense that astronomers determined&nbsp;it was one of the densest, and therefore&nbsp;youngest, planetary nebulae known – about&nbsp;a thousand years young. And while NGC&nbsp;7027 is too dim to be noticeable with the&nbsp;unaided eye, the nebula formed coincidentally around the same time as the ancient&nbsp;skywatchers chronicled in 1006 the appearance of a supernova in Lupus. This coincidence, as you will soon see, is also ironic,&nbsp;because the more professional astronomers&nbsp;studied NGC 7027, they more they learned&nbsp;about the ultimate fate of stars more massive than our Sun.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">One early finding, in 1967, was that NGC 7027 is not only a strong radio source but&nbsp;also a strong emitter of infrared radiation,&nbsp;an indication that NGC 7027 is, and probably all planetary nebulae are, very dusty&nbsp;places – though universal acceptance of&nbsp;that truth had to wait until the launch&nbsp;of the Infrared Astronomical Satellite in&nbsp;January 1983. The spectrum of NGC 7027 is&nbsp;rich atomic lines and complex molecules,&nbsp;including some complex organic compounds. But while the nebula was steadily&nbsp;giving up its secrets, NGC 7027's central star&nbsp;remained elusive to study, until the Hubble&nbsp;Space Telescope (HST) imaged NGC 7027&nbsp;in 1997 with its near-infrared camera and&nbsp;multi-object spectrometer (NICMOS).</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">As principal investigator William B. Latter (SIRTF Science Center/IPAC/Caltech) and colleagues describe, NICMOS clearly&nbsp;revealed the central star, which has a temperature of some 200,000 <span class="font2"><sup>◦</sup> </span><span class="font19">C, making it one&nbsp;of the hottest stars known. It sits at the center of a white ring of gas and dust cast off by&nbsp;the star. This region is highly ionized – atoms&nbsp;are ripped apart into nuclei and electrons by&nbsp;radiation from the hot central star. This ring</span></p></td></tr></table><hr>

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;">has a temperature of several tens of thousands of degrees. The ring, which is reminiscent of M57, the Ring Nebula in Lyra, is surrounded by a fluorescent pink pillow&nbsp;of molecular hydrogen. Here is the boundary layer between the ionized shell and the&nbsp;surrounding molecular envelope; the region&nbsp;glows pink because the molecules here are&nbsp;being violently split into separate hydrogen&nbsp;atoms by the stellar ultraviolet radiation.&nbsp;The pillow is actually two cones of light seen&nbsp;at an angle of 45<span class="font2"><sup>◦</sup> </span><span class="font19">. Another interesting feature of these data is the appearance of a disturbance that might be caused by an as yet&nbsp;unseen jet of material that is inclined from&nbsp;the main axis of the object.</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Prior to the HST observations, NGC 7027 was believed to be a proto-planetary nebula&nbsp;(one with a central star still too cool for it to&nbsp;ionize the core region), but we now see it as a&nbsp;planetary nebula in the early stages of evolution. Indeed, the nebula is exceptionally&nbsp;small. While most planetary nebula we see&nbsp;in the sky extend about 1 light-year in true&nbsp;physical extent, NGC 7027 measures only&nbsp;0.2 <span class="font5">× </span><span class="font19">0.1 light-years. The central star has&nbsp;a mass of about 0.7 Sun and appears to&nbsp;have left the asymptotic giant branch of&nbsp;theHertzsprung–Russelldiagram about 700&nbsp;years ago, which is a mere breath in the lifetime of a star.</span></p></td>
<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">The gas in the circumstellar envelope is mostly made up of simple molecules such&nbsp;as molecular hydrogen and carbon monoxide, combined with several other gases&nbsp;such as cyanide, sodium chloride, and possibly water vapor. Complex hydrocarbon&nbsp;molecules are also known to be present in&nbsp;circumstellar envelopes. Most importantly,&nbsp;the material cast off during this phase of stellar evolution includes a large abundance of&nbsp;the key elements to the origin of terrestrial&nbsp;life – carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen. These&nbsp;elements are created through nuclear fusion&nbsp;of hydrogen and helium in the stellar core.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Since planetary nebulae were believed to be formed from the remnants of circumstellar envelopes of asymptotic giant branch&nbsp;stars, the discovery of molecules in NGC&nbsp;7027's envelope (and in those of other planetary nebulae) is important; these molecules&nbsp;have the same spectral characteristics as&nbsp;those detected in well-studied asymptotic&nbsp;giant branch stars, such as CW Leonis.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">The estimated molecular mass in the expanding halo of NGC 7027 is about 3 Suns,&nbsp;or about 100 times the mass contained in&nbsp;the ionized shell. That discovery is of vast&nbsp;importance. In 1930, Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar applied Einstein's theory of special relativity to the structure of white dwarfs&nbsp;and demonstrated that the maximum mass&nbsp;for white dwarfs is 1.4 solar masses (known&nbsp;as Chandrasekhar's limit). If we accept this&nbsp;limit, a star born with a mass greater than&nbsp;1.4 solar masses could not become a white&nbsp;dwarf; it would have to end its life in a supernova explosion. If true, supernovae should&nbsp;be a frequent occurrence in our galaxy. But&nbsp;they are not. Clearly, something is amiss.</p></td></tr></table><hr>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">The combined mass of NGC 7027's central star and&nbsp;that of its molecular envelope&nbsp;implies that this planetary&nbsp;nebula must have descended&nbsp;from a star with an initial mass of at least 4 solar&nbsp;masses. These data and others became essential evidence in a theory that stated&nbsp;stars born with masses several times higher than the&nbsp;Sun will not become supernovae, but end their lives&nbsp;as planetary nebulae instead.&nbsp;“While stars maintain a constant mass through most of&nbsp;their billion-year lifetime,”&nbsp;Sun Kwok explains, “they&nbsp;undergo a rapid weight loss&nbsp;in the last one million years</p><div style="float:right;layout-flow:horizontal;"><img src="Hidden Treasures_files/Hidden Treasures-468.jpg" style="width:255pt;height:267pt;"/></div>

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;">of their lives. The last minute weight loss allows a star to avoid a violent death as a&nbsp;supernova. In spite of the glamorous status&nbsp;of supernovae and black holes in the minds&nbsp;of many people, they are relevant to the lives&nbsp;of only a small fraction of all stars. Planetary nebulae, not supernovae, are the fate&nbsp;of most stars. Unlike old soldiers, old stars&nbsp;do die. But, like them, most just quietly fade&nbsp;away.”</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Even though little of this was known to me at the time I first saw NGC 7027, I had much&nbsp;to think about as I peered into the eyepiece&nbsp;and listened to Peter describe the significance of the exciting early radio and infrared&nbsp;discoveries. I was soon swimming in a visual&nbsp;mire. The swollen disk of NGC 7027 was&nbsp;not so much a visual wonder, at least not&nbsp;at the time, but one with a secret and seductive invisible nature. Now when I look at&nbsp;NGC 7027, I have an even greater appreciation for the significance of the scene. As Lat-tersays,“WehavecaughtNGC7027atavery&nbsp;important time for study . . . This is an object&nbsp;that will survive in its present state for only&nbsp;the blink of an eye (in cosmological time).”</p></td>

Moderate&nbsp;powers give the illusion that the planetary&nbsp;has a bright central star surrounded by an&nbsp;asymmetrical crown of light. But the longer&nbsp;I look at it at moderate power, I get the distinct feeling that something is wrong: that&nbsp;there are two objects here.</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">High power (the highest possible), in my case 504<span class="font5">×</span><span class="font19">, reveals a most puzzling sight.

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">But the most fascinating aspect of the bright north-northwest section, especially&nbsp;aftermanylongminutesofobservingathigh&nbsp;power is that it breaks up into a cruciform&nbsp;of knots of various brightnesses. Together,&nbsp;these knots forman annulus or appear to do&nbsp;so. But the knots do not stand out so clearly&nbsp;from the nebulosity.

The nebula&nbsp;has two other popular names, the Green&nbsp;Rectangle and the Magic Carpet Nebula.&nbsp;Both were given by Kent Wallace (Navaho&nbsp;Flats).

In fact, an analysis of the&nbsp;color-magnitude diagram of the brightest&nbsp;members of Trumpler 37 indicated that low-mass pre-main-sequence stars should exist&nbsp;in the cluster itself.</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">One thing is for certain, the nucleus of Trumpler 37 (one of the youngest star clusters known in our galaxy) is a wonder unto&nbsp;itself. Here is the star complex HD 206267,&nbsp;whose hottest component, a magnitude 5.6&nbsp;Type <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">O</span><span class="font19">6.5V star, is the main source of excitation of IC 1396; in many respects this&nbsp;complex is similar to the Orion Trapezium,&nbsp;though twice as distant, having three fainter&nbsp;stars: companion B at 1</span><span class="font2"><sup>^^</sup></span><span class="font19">.6 ( V </span><span class="font5">= </span><span class="font19">13.6), companion C at 11</span><span class="font2"><sup>^^</sup></span><span class="font19">.7 ( V </span><span class="font5">= </span><span class="font19">8.1), and companion D at 19</span><span class="font2"><sup>^^</sup></span><span class="font19">.9 ( V </span><span class="font5">= </span><span class="font19">8.0). The main component itself has long been classified as a&nbsp;spectroscopic binary with an orbital period&nbsp;of 3.7 days. Its ultraviolet spectrum also&nbsp;reveals a third eclipsing Type </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">O</span><span class="font19"> component.&nbsp;The two brightest components have a mass&nbsp;of about 40 Suns and an additional speckle&nbsp;component may also exist.</span></p></td>
<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">The surrounding nebula, IC 1396, is quite rich in bright-rimmed globules. Such globules are usually found in presumably old&nbsp;H-II regions and resemble compact and&nbsp;massive areas of H-I interacting with the surrounding neutral and cooler gas. In particular, two bright-rimmed clouds IC 1396A and&nbsp;B, which are centered about 30<span class="font2"><sup>^</sup> </span><span class="font19">to the west of&nbsp;HD 206267, have been the focus of previous&nbsp;investigations. Near the center of IC 1396A,&nbsp;two very young T Tauri stars (about 100,000&nbsp;years old) have been identified. Both stars&nbsp;may have been born simultaneously and&nbsp;are still in the pre-main-sequence stage. The&nbsp;central part of this globule may resemble a&nbsp;cavity that is formed by interaction of the&nbsp;stellar wind from the pre-main-sequence&nbsp;stars and the globule.</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">In December of 2003, the Spitzer Space Telescope (formerly known as the Space&nbsp;Infrared Telescope Facility) penetrated the&nbsp;interior of one of the most famous globules in IC 1396 (the Elephant's Trunk Nebula) and found bright reddish proto-stars&nbsp;within. And in a 2005 <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Astronomy and Astrophysics</span><span class="font19"> paper, Irish astronomer D. Froe-brich (Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies) and colleagues present data on a&nbsp;large-scale study of the IC 1396 region&nbsp;using new deep near-infrared and optical images, complemented by 2MASS satellite data. For ten globules in IC 1396, the&nbsp;researchers identified the young stellar population within. Five of these globules contain a rich population of reddened objects,&nbsp;most of them probably young stellar objects.&nbsp;Two new Herbig–Haro were also identified. Using star counts based on 2MASS&nbsp;data, the researchers identified 25 globules&nbsp;whose masses show a significant increase&nbsp;with the distance from the exciting star&nbsp;(HD 206267).

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">To find this stunning region, you simply need to locate 4th-magnitude Mu Cepheii,&nbsp;which is about 4 <span class="font17"><sub>4</sub><sup>3 </sup></span><span class="font2"><sup>◦</sup> </span><span class="font19">southeast of 2nd-magnitude Alpha (</span><span class="font5">^</span><span class="font19">) Cepheii (Alderamin) or&nbsp;3</span><span class="font17"><sub>2</sub><sup>1</sup></span><span class="font2"><sup>◦</sup> </span><span class="font19">west-northwest of Zeta (</span><span class="font5">^</span><span class="font19">) Cepheii.

The&nbsp;nebula looked a tad more distinct in 7 </span><span class="font5">× </span><span class="font19">50&nbsp;binoculars, surrounding an&nbsp;X-shaped asterism of stars,&nbsp;but I had the same nagging&nbsp;doubt.</span></p></td>
<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:71pt;">As for the cluster, the view in the 4-inch is outstanding. The first and most obvious object to strike the eye&nbsp;is the magnitude 5.6 star&nbsp;at the core of the cluster,&nbsp;HD 206267, the striking triple&nbsp;star system otherwise known&nbsp;as Struve 2816. At 23<span class="font5">×</span><span class="font19">, it&nbsp;appears only as a double,&nbsp;but it is immediately a triple&nbsp;at 72 </span><span class="font5">×</span><span class="font19">. What's most intriguing is that, while the star is&nbsp;classified as a Type </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">O</span><span class="font19"> star,&nbsp;it appears to have a most&nbsp;definite yellow hue. Randy&nbsp;Moench (Northern Colorado&nbsp;Astronomical Society) had&nbsp;the same impression with a 7-inch Maksutov. As for the two companions, one has a&nbsp;yellowish tinge with a dusty rose sheen, and&nbsp;the other has a slight greenish hue. Moench&nbsp;cuts to the quick and says that “each star in&nbsp;the triplet offers a different color making it&nbsp;a real gem.”</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Beyond the mesmerizing core, long looping arms extend radially about the cluster, forming petals that give the cluster the appearance of a four-leaf-clover. Add the&nbsp;mistiness of the surrounding nebulosity and&nbsp;you arrive at my coined name for the cluster. It's quite a spectacle, given the richness&nbsp;of the cluster and the Milky Way background&nbsp;light. It's easy to get lost among the masses,&nbsp;but overall, the arms extending from the&nbsp;core mimic thearms and legs ofthe constellation Hercules, or that of an Alaskan King&nbsp;Crab.</p></td></tr></table><hr>

In a 1999 <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Sky and Telescope</span><span class="font19"> magazine, James Mullaney eloquently&nbsp;notes that the “huge nebulous expanse&nbsp;demands a very dark, transparent night and&nbsp;fully dark-adapted eyes.

The&nbsp;view of this entire amazing&nbsp;region of sky through the eyepiece of a rich-field telescope&nbsp;leaves no doubt that this is&nbsp;indeed an apt assessment.”</span></p></td>
<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">I can see a multitude of dark nebulae, without a filter, within the nebulosity.&nbsp;(But remember, this is under&nbsp;a very dark sky and with&nbsp;a nearly 3 <span class="font2"><sup>◦</sup> </span><span class="font19">field of view.)&nbsp;The dark nebulae become&nbsp;enhanced if I slightly defocus the image then tap the&nbsp;telescope tube gently to set&nbsp;the object in motion, which&nbsp;helps the eye–brain system to&nbsp;detect faint light. The most&nbsp;obvious lagoon of darkness&nbsp;is Barnard 161, located 30</span><span class="font2"><sup>^&nbsp;</sup></span><span class="font19">north and slightly east of&nbsp;HD 206267.

There is, in&nbsp;fact, a lot of gray, smoky nebulosity (not&nbsp;black, not white) here as well.</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">If you live under suburban skies, try using a filter to enhance the nebula. David Knisley (Prairie Astronomy Club), who used a 10-inch f/5.6 Newtonian reflector, at 59<span class="font5">×</span><span class="font19">,70</span><span class="font5">×</span><span class="font19">,&nbsp;and 141 </span><span class="font5">× </span><span class="font19">recommends using an ultra-high-contrast or deep-sky filter which will not&nbsp;only make the nebulosity more visible but&nbsp;also the dark inclusion of Barnard 161 more&nbsp;definite, “but the glow is still faint.” Then&nbsp;again, the matter is still up for debate. As&nbsp;Moench says, “[n]o nebulosity was detected&nbsp;in either the wide field 3-inch refractor or&nbsp;the 7-inch Maksutov using Skyview, UHC or&nbsp;O-III filters,” though there is no reason for&nbsp;this emission nebula to appear bright in an&nbsp;O-III filter.</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Return to Mu Cepheii.

It was a scene&nbsp;straight from Walter Hartright's narrative in&nbsp;Wilkie Collin's novel <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">The Woman in White</span><span class="font19">:&nbsp;“In the time when my dread of losing her&nbsp;was most present to my mind, I had always&nbsp;kissed her when she left me at night and&nbsp;when she met me in the morning.” It was&nbsp;also a fitting romantic interlude between&nbsp;the two objects Caroline Herschel loved the&nbsp;most – nebulae and comets. Her kinship for&nbsp;these new finds are reflected in a December&nbsp;22, 1788, letter to the “Rev. Dr. Maskelyne,”&nbsp;in which she reports her discovery of a new&nbsp;comet and pens this plea, “I beg the favour&nbsp;of you to take it under your protection.”&nbsp;She signed the letter “Your most obliged,&nbsp;humble servant.”</span></p></td>

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">When Caroline Herschel discovered NGC 7380 in 1787, things were rather hectic:&nbsp;“The discovery of the Georgian satellites&nbsp;caused many breaks in the sweeps which&nbsp;were made at the end of 1786 and beginning of 1787,” she writes in her memoirs,&nbsp;“by leaving off abruptly against the meridian passage of the planet, which occasioned&nbsp;much work.” She also noted that the discovery of these satellites “brought many nocturnal visitors to Slough . . . and many times&nbsp;I have listened with pain to the conversation my brother held with his astronomical&nbsp;friends when quite exhausted by answering&nbsp;their numerous questions.” Caroline had&nbsp;also begun work on a temporary “index to&nbsp;Flamsteed's observations,” and “calculating&nbsp;the beginning and ending of sweeps and&nbsp;their breadth.” What's more, her brother&nbsp;Jacob was visiting “from April till October&nbsp;1787,” the 40-foot reflector was being completed, William was preparing for marriage,&nbsp;and Missus Herschel was ill. (She died in&nbsp;January of 1788.) Still, as Caroline writes,&nbsp;“The fine nights were not neglected, though&nbsp;observations were often interrupted by visitors.” But the year of 1787 was also a special&nbsp;one for Caroline. It's the year King George&nbsp;III gave her a <span class="font18">£</span><span class="font19">50 per year salary to continue&nbsp;as William's assistant, making her the first&nbsp;woman officially recognized for a scientific&nbsp;position. Her discovery of NGC 7380 that&nbsp;year, then, came when she was a salaried&nbsp;astronomer.</span></p></td></tr></table><hr>

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">To Caroline and her brother William, NGC 7380 was merely a coarsely scattered&nbsp;cluster of stars.

Mario Motta also noticed the dark&nbsp;nebulosity and saw a broad band slicing&nbsp;east–west just north of the cluster's main&nbsp;body. I was fighting to convince myself that&nbsp;the bright nebulosity was real, because this&nbsp;Milky Way region is so replete with veins&nbsp;of dark nebulosity which cuts up the Milky&nbsp;Way like separate tectonic plates – islands&nbsp;of starlight floating on an ocean of ink. It's&nbsp;almost maddening to fathom. However, the&nbsp;cluster had a ghostly quality to it – a glow that&nbsp;differs ever so slightly from that of neighboring stellar patches. This is something that&nbsp;has to be appreciated from a dark sky.</span></p>

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;">The night sky is filled with hidden treasures, more than we can imagine. To see them, all we have to do is&nbsp;keep our eyes and minds open. A celestial&nbsp;treasure does not have to be a galaxy,&nbsp;nebula, or cluster.

The treasure's worth is a matter of&nbsp;personal appeal. Does it bring a smile to our&nbsp;face when we see it? Does it kindle even the&nbsp;smallest of flames in our hearts? The 107th&nbsp;treasure in this catalog may be one of those&nbsp;objects. You will have to judge. You might&nbsp;not have heard of it, because its discovery is&nbsp;relatively new.

<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">On the evening of January 20, 2003, I was driving helter-skelter across Volcano,&nbsp;Hawaii, looking for a clear spot between&nbsp;clouds to get a glimpse of Comet 2002 V1&nbsp;(NEAT). But the weather failed to cooperate. Giving up the chase, I turned off the Volcano Highway and started to return home.&nbsp;Suddenly, I saw a hole in the clouds to&nbsp;the west. Quickly, I pulled the car over and&nbsp;turned off the engine. Grabbing my 7 <span class="font5">×&nbsp;</span><span class="font19">50 binoculars from the passenger seat, I&nbsp;slipped outside and promptly found the 6th-magnitude comet in southeastern Pegasus&nbsp;near the Pisces border. Quickly, but carefully, I scanned the region for comparison&nbsp;stars, so I could estimate the comet's brightness. That's when I spied a large diffuse&nbsp;object some1</span><span class="font17"><sub>2</sub><sup>1</sup></span><span class="font2"><sup>◦</sup> </span><span class="font19">south of the comet and 2</span><span class="font17"><sub>4</sub><sup>1</sup></span><span class="font2"><sup>◦&nbsp;</sup></span><span class="font19">north of Iota (</span><span class="font5">^</span><span class="font19">) Pisces, in the famous Circlet&nbsp;of Pisces. The new object looked like a comet&nbsp;with multiple nuclei strung out in a line.&nbsp;Suddenly I recalled the famous “squashed&nbsp;comet” Carolyn Shoemaker discovered in&nbsp;1993 while scanning photographic plates&nbsp;taken by her husband, Eugene, and David&nbsp;Levy; this comet, Shoemaker-Levy 9, had&nbsp;fragmented into more than 20 pieces before&nbsp;it ultimately smashed into Jupiter the following year, giving observers around the&nbsp;world one of the most memorable astronomical experiences of their lives.</span></p></td></tr></table><hr>

<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">For a moment I wondered if Comet 2002 V1 had broken apart in similar fashion. Better yet, had I stumbled upon a new comet,&nbsp;perhaps a faint one that had flared inbrightness as it split apart? I had witnessed several comets perform in this manner over the&nbsp;years. Was this an unknown event? Before&nbsp;I could finish my thoughts, fate turned&nbsp;against me; the hole in the clouds closed&nbsp;andI lost sight of the stars. Fortunately, I had&nbsp;memorized the new object's position. Without hesitation, I returned to the car, found a&nbsp;pen, and recorded the new object's position&nbsp;as best I could on a paper napkin.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">The skies remained overcast for two days. So you can imagine my state of mind and&nbsp;heart – especially after I had confirmed that&nbsp;no known comets (other than Comet 2002&nbsp;V1) – were in the area. I also checked all my&nbsp;starchartsfordeep-skyobjectsinornearthe&nbsp;suspect'sposition.Oddlyenough,twogalax-ies (NGC 7742 and NGC 7743) were within&nbsp;2<span class="font2"><sup>◦</sup> </span><span class="font19">of comet NEAT and my suspect's mean&nbsp;position. What's more, these galaxies shared&nbsp;a similar north–south orientation and separation. I grilled myself with questions. Did&nbsp;I record the object's correct position? Was&nbsp;I confused by the hole in the clouds? Did&nbsp;I really see the comet, or was I looking at&nbsp;these two galaxies?

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">I had little to do but wait until the evening of January 22, 2003. That night I brought&nbsp;my binoculars and my 4-inch telescope into&nbsp;the front yard under a crystal clear sky. I&nbsp;found Comet 2002 V1 in binoculars and&nbsp;estimated its brightness – magnitude 5.8; it&nbsp;was the object I saw on January 20. Next&nbsp;I scanned the sky with binoculars for the&nbsp;“strange object.” And there it was, <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">exactly&nbsp;</span><span class="font19">where I had plotted it. Alas, it was not a&nbsp;comet, which would have moved by even&nbsp;a modest amount in two days (unless it was&nbsp;on a collision course with Earth). So, I wondered, what is it?</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">The telescope revealed the truth. My squashed comet isalovelygathering of nine&nbsp;8th- to 11th-magnitude suns in an area measuring a mere 15<span class="font2"><sup>^</sup> </span><span class="font19">across.

He had&nbsp;discovered these objects&nbsp;between 1997 and 1998 while&nbsp;looking at plots for clumps&nbsp;of galactic star clusters or&nbsp;by examining Digitized Sky&nbsp;Survey images. Stellar parallax data suggest no real link&nbsp;between the stars, so they are&nbsp;not a physical group but a&nbsp;chance alignment.

By including this object in his catalog, Messier was&nbsp;sending a warning to comet hunters that&nbsp;close pairings of dim stars can masquerade as comets in small apertures. It's the&nbsp;same with the naked-eye appearance of the&nbsp;famous Coathanger; what looks like a star-studded nebula to the naked eye is really a&nbsp;wonderful asterism of binocular stars in the&nbsp;shape of a coathanger.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">So my discovery tale is nothing new. It is part of a never-ending story, one that&nbsp;Messier and his contemporaries knew all&nbsp;too well. It was quite common in Messier's&nbsp;day for comet hunters to make discoveries of deep-sky objects while they were&nbsp;searching for, or observing, known comets.&nbsp;Indeed, what inspired Messier to create his&nbsp;catalog of non-comets was his independent discovery of the Crab Nebula (M1) in&nbsp;Taurus while observing the comet of 1758.&nbsp;Jean-Dominique Miraldi II had a similar&nbsp;experience; his discovery of M2, a globular&nbsp;cluster in Aquarius, occurred while he was&nbsp;looking for de Che´ seaux's comet in 1746: “I&nbsp;took, at first, this nebula for the comet.”</p></td>

Consider how popular Kemble's Cascade (HT 21)&nbsp;has become. Perhaps you have also heard of&nbsp;Pazmino's Cluster (Stock 23) in Cassiopeia;&nbsp;New York amateur John Pazmino independently discovered this magnitude 6.5 open&nbsp;cluster on the Camelopardalis–Cassiopeia&nbsp;border in the late 1970s with a 4.3-inch&nbsp;refractor. Although Pazmino is not the official discoverer of this cluster, his name has&nbsp;become intimately attached to it ever since&nbsp;he announced his finding in the March 1978&nbsp;issue of<span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Sky &amp; Telescope.</span><span class="font19"> So do not fear to put&nbsp;a formal stamp on your personal discovery,&nbsp;even if it only appears as such in your logbook or diary.

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Caroline Herschel discovered this beautiful object in the fall of 1783. And it was upon this discovery that, as Adm.

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:9pt;padding:0pt 0pt 0pt 7pt;">There are some 580 stars in the cluster – the brightest&nbsp;shines at magnitude 10.0&nbsp;while the faintest hover&nbsp;around magnitude 18. A&nbsp;pleasing number of them,&nbsp;perhaps 60 or so, can be spied&nbsp;in the 4-inch at 23<span class="font5">×</span><span class="font19">, with&nbsp;which the cluster may just&nbsp;be at its best.

In fact, through&nbsp;binoculars, the cluster looks like a tailless&nbsp;comet crossing the rich star fields of the&nbsp;northern Milky Way. With just a few minutes of scrutiny, though, the cluster should&nbsp;begin to sparkle – a phenomenon caused by&nbsp;the light of dim suns popping in and out of&nbsp;view in your peripheral vision. Concentrate&nbsp;now on the cluster's core with averted vision.&nbsp;Doyou see a central core of light surrounded&nbsp;by a larger and fainter halo of largely unresolved suns?</span></p></td>
<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">As the cluster was a bit too large to make a decent magnitude estimate with binoculars&nbsp;(the eyepieces did not rack out far enough),&nbsp;I had to rely on the sliding tubes of my&nbsp;antique telescope. Through that telescope,&nbsp;the cluster appears compressed at the core,&nbsp;partially resolved, and particularly clumpy,&nbsp;three-dimensional at 23<span class="font5">×</span><span class="font19">; it looks as if some&nbsp;pirate, eager to eye his bounty, had poured&nbsp;a fistful of diamond dust into his blackened&nbsp;hands and squeezed them hard with greed.&nbsp;In an equally sinister way, the core resembles a skull, with two oval rings of stars marking its eye sockets, and a curving dark lane of&nbsp;obscuring matter marking the skull's open&nbsp;jaw.

Now look for&nbsp;curved extensions off these&nbsp;arms, making it appear to&nbsp;have a counterclockwise&nbsp;spiral structure.

NGC 7789's horseshoe asterism bears an uncanny&nbsp;resemblance to the main form of NGC 663&nbsp;(Caldwell 10) in Cassiopeia, which is known&nbsp;as the Horseshoe Cluster. Be sure to compare the two clusters on the same night.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Now look midway between the 7th- and 9th-magnitude stars. Do you see a small puff&nbsp;of “nebulosity?” This is a minute clustering&nbsp;of six dim suns in the shape of a fishhook,&nbsp;which is visible as such only at high power.</p></td>
<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">It's very difficult to judge the cluster's boundaries; the stars fly off in long arms, all&nbsp;form. Look for parallel rows of wavy suns&nbsp;intermixed with large loops of stars. Now,&nbsp;turn the focus knob at this power and place&nbsp;the cluster ever so slightly out of focus. The&nbsp;easternmost eye socket transforms into a&nbsp;beautiful “smoke ring.” It really requires a&nbsp;delicate touch. Using powers greater than&nbsp;100 <span class="font5">× </span><span class="font19">transforms the tight core into all manner of patches of starlight, arcs, ellipses,&nbsp;trapezoids, clusterings, and pairings.</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">With every change of magnification, the cluster takes on a new appearance. It is,&nbsp;without question, the Lon Chaney<a name="footnote12"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark248">12</a></sup><span class="font17"><sup></sup> </span><span class="font19">of star&nbsp;clusters; I never tire of looking at this celestial marvel. At the accepted distance of 6,000&nbsp;light-years, the cluster's angular diameter&nbsp;corresponds to a respectable physical size&nbsp;of 44 light-years. The cluster's age is about&nbsp;1.6 billion years, making it intermediate&nbsp;in age – a contemporary of NGC 752&nbsp;(Caldwell 28) in Andromeda, which is&nbsp;2 billion years old. The brighter and more&nbsp;massive stars in NGC 7789 have already&nbsp;exhausted the hydrogen fuel in their cores,&nbsp;so they have evolved from hydrogen burning stars like our Sun into red giants and&nbsp;subgiants, which, if you look carefully, reveal&nbsp;themselves with their tepid orange hue. The&nbsp;cluster is also rich in variable stars, 45 of&nbsp;which were identified by Polish astronomers&nbsp;in 1999, including 35 eclipsing binaries, two&nbsp;RR Lyrae stars, and one Delta Scuti star&nbsp;(whichisabluestraggler–astarthatappears&nbsp;to linger on the main sequence – belonging&nbsp;to the cluster).

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">As pointed out by Smyth, the Milky Way surrounding NGC 7789 is equally impressive, especially in wide-field telescopes.&nbsp;Most noteworthy is the complex of dark&nbsp;nebulae in and around the cluster. These&nbsp;impressive veils are not outlined on any star&nbsp;atlas that I'm aware of.</p></td>
<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Two stars in the immediate vicinity of NGC 7789 are of particular interest. Alex&nbsp;J. R. Lobel and Andrea Dupree (Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics) suspect that Rho Cassiopeia, a hypergiant star&nbsp;as hot as the Sun but roughly a million&nbsp;times more luminous, is in the very last&nbsp;stages of its evolution and could go supernova in as little as 50,000 years. In 2000,&nbsp;the star underwent the largest stellar mass&nbsp;ejection ever recorded, ejecting 50 Earths&nbsp;per day for 200 days. About 5 percent of&nbsp;a solar mass was expended during that&nbsp;event, which is roughly a thousandth of&nbsp;Rho Cas's mass. Since the star cannot withstand many more such mass ejections and&nbsp;remain stable, it's believed the end is near for&nbsp;Rho.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">The second star, Sigma Cassiopeia, pales by comparison – at least in potential drama.&nbsp;In color, though, it's one of the best – a&nbsp;close pair of blue-green gems in a rich field&nbsp;teeming with jewels. The primary shines&nbsp;at magnitude 5.0; the secondary shines at&nbsp;magnitude 7.1; the stars were separated by&nbsp;2.4<span class="font2"><sup>^^</sup> </span><span class="font19">in 2002, making them a decent challenge for small telescopes. Of course, no&nbsp;two people see the colors of these stars&nbsp;the same. Admiral Smyth, for instance,&nbsp;saw the primary as “flushed white” and&nbsp;the secondary as “smalt blue.” He also&nbsp;says, “The colours are clear and distinct,&nbsp;though less fine than those of </span><span class="font3">ε </span><span class="font19">Bootis,&nbsp;of which this is a miniature.” You be the&nbsp;judge.</span></p></td></tr></table><hr><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;"><img src="Hidden Treasures_files/Hidden Treasures-485.jpg" style="width:389pt;height:512pt;"/></div><br clear="all">

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">An optical study in 1997 using charge coupled device (CCD) imageryandinterference filters indicated 28 objects that have morphologies consistent with supernova remnants. These are the first large samples of&nbsp;supernova remnants identified in galaxies&nbsp;outside the Local Group. A later radio study&nbsp;in 2002 using the Very Large Array added&nbsp;five new candidate supernova remnants to&nbsp;the 28 already detected by optical methods.&nbsp;One of these remnants, identified as N7793-S26, has been detected at three wavelengths: X-ray, optical, and radio. It has a&nbsp;long filamentary morphology and its radio&nbsp;luminosity exceeds that of the Milky Way's&nbsp;Cassiopeia A: a supernova remnant.

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;">Caroline lucretia herschel was born in Hanover, Germany, on March 16,&nbsp;1750. She was the eighth of 10 children&nbsp;born to Isaac and Anna and nearly 12 years&nbsp;younger than her revered older brother,&nbsp;Friedrich Wilhelm (later William). She had,&nbsp;like her father and William, a penchant&nbsp;for music and was a talented soprano. In&nbsp;1778 she was offered an engagement for&nbsp;the Birmingham Festival, but she declined,&nbsp;having resolved to sing in public only where&nbsp;her brother, William, was conductor.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">The strong attachment and affection between Caroline and William began as&nbsp;soon as Caroline could show or express&nbsp;her feelings and continued throughout their&nbsp;lives. Caroline (affectionately known as&nbsp;Lina) was tiny, standing only about 4 feet 9&nbsp;inches tall. She suffered smallpox at the age&nbsp;of 3 (which stunted her growth) and typhus&nbsp;at the age of 11; she nearly succumbed to&nbsp;that disease. As Caroline recalled, the typhus&nbsp;had reduced her strength to such a degree&nbsp;that “for several months after I was obliged&nbsp;to mount the stairs on my hands and feet like&nbsp;an infant; but here I will remark that from&nbsp;that time to this present day ( June 5, 1821) I&nbsp;do not remember ever to have spent a whole&nbsp;day in bed.”</p></td>
<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">From infancy to old age, William was the “best and dearest of brothers.” Indeed, in&nbsp;August1772,WilliambroughtCarolinetohis&nbsp;home in Bath, England, saving her from a&nbsp;drearylife as a “household drudge,” and she&nbsp;was clearly grateful to him: “I saw that all my&nbsp;exertions would not save me from becoming&nbsp;a burden to my brothers, I was not qualified&nbsp;to become a governess for want of knowledge in languages. My father cautioned me&nbsp;against all thoughts of marrying, saying as I&nbsp;was neither hansom nor rich.”</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Blue-eyed Caroline was not only physically small in height, but she had disfiguring scarring on her face resulting from her bout with smallpox. Her appearance was not&nbsp;unusual, as smallpox scarring was a common occurrence at the time. In fact, much of&nbsp;the population suffered disfigurement from&nbsp;the more severe and most common form&nbsp;of the disease (variola) until 1798, when&nbsp;vaccination campaigns started. Commenting on her appearance Caroline states:&nbsp;“Although I recovered [from smallpox], I&nbsp;did not escape being totally disfigured&nbsp;and suffering some injury to my left&nbsp;eye.”</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">When Caroline arrived in Bath, William had already established himself as a teacher&nbsp;of music. He was also organist of the&nbsp;Octagon Chapel and frequently composed&nbsp;anthems, chants, and entire services for the&nbsp;choir. But Caroline also arrived at the turning point in her brother's career – from&nbsp;music master to master observer of the night</p></td></tr></table><hr>

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">As Mrs. John Herschel recorded in her 1879 <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Memoir and Correspondence of Caroline Herschel</span><span class="font19">,<a name="footnote13"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark253">13</a></sup></span><span class="font17"><sup></sup> </span><span class="font19">“No contrast could be&nbsp;sharper than that presented by the narrow&nbsp;domestic routine she had left to the life&nbsp;of ceaseless and inexhaustible activity into&nbsp;which she was plunged . . . For ten years&nbsp;she persevered at Bath, singing when she&nbsp;was told to sing, copying when she was told&nbsp;to copy, ‘lending a hand' in the workshop,&nbsp;and taking her full share in all the stirring&nbsp;and exciting changes by which the musician became the King's astronomer and a&nbsp;celebrity.”</span></p></td>
<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Her brother's rise to fame was, of course, owing to the discovery of the planet we&nbsp;now call Uranus. King George III, William's&nbsp;patron (and for whom William wanted to&nbsp;name the new world), arranged for William&nbsp;to give up his musical career and settle in&nbsp;the vicinity of Windsor Castle, where he&nbsp;would be obliged, on occasion, to show&nbsp;the Royal Family celestial objects of interest through his telescope. In return, William&nbsp;would receive a salary of <span class="font18">£</span><span class="font19">200 a year. The&nbsp;King subsequently made an allowance of&nbsp;</span><span class="font18">£</span><span class="font19">50 a year to Caroline as her brother's assistant, making her the first woman professional astronomer. “I received 12 pounds&nbsp;being the first quarterly payment,” Caroline&nbsp;writes, “and the first money in all my lifetime&nbsp;I ever thought myself at liberty to spend to&nbsp;my own liking.”</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Caroline's career as an astronomer started on August 2, 1782, once she and her brother&nbsp;moved to Datchet – a tiny village about 3&nbsp;kilometers east of Windsor Castle, on the&nbsp;north bank of the Thames. Caroline's days&nbsp;were filled with writing down her brother's&nbsp;discoveries and calculating their positions.&nbsp;She prepared all his papers for publication by the Royal Society of London. She&nbsp;ground mirrors, hired the gardeners, kept&nbsp;the household running, did needlework,&nbsp;cleaned the brass-work for the telescopes&nbsp;her brother used, and entertained their distinguished guests. She was the consummate&nbsp;multitasker.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">William was also training Caroline to be an assistant observer. And on August 22,&nbsp;1782, she began sweeping the skies with&nbsp;a small telescope built by her brother and&nbsp;adapted for “sweeping.” The telescope consisted of a “tube with two glasses, such as&nbsp;are commonly used in a ‘finder'.” Her task&nbsp;was “‘to sweep for comets,' and I see by&nbsp;my journal that I began . . . to write down&nbsp;and describe all remarkable appearances I&nbsp;saw in my ‘sweeps,' which were horizon-tal.”Williamalsoinstructed her to search for&nbsp;double stars, clusters of stars, and nebulae.&nbsp;He gave her instructions on how to describe&nbsp;them by lines from certain stars and figures drawn on paper. During these sweeps,&nbsp;she kept Messier's list of nebulous objects&nbsp;by her side. The list, published in the 1784&nbsp;<span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Connaissance des Temps,</span><span class="font19"> was a gift to her&nbsp;brother from the London businessman and&nbsp;prominent amateur astronomer, Alexander&nbsp;Aubert, soon after its appearance.</span></p></td></tr></table><hr>

<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">As Caroline swept the heavens for comets and other remarkable objects, William&nbsp;focused his attention on his “third review of&nbsp;the heavens,” which he had begun at Bath&nbsp;with 6.2-inch and 12-inch reflectors. Herschel was reviewing all Flamsteed stars, to&nbsp;find and measure doubles. Little was known&nbsp;about double stars, their nature, and their&nbsp;motions, and William's examination of them&nbsp;was the first systematic survey. Observations continued from dusk to dawn, many&nbsp;hours at a time, and he often examined 400&nbsp;stars a night.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;padding:0pt 0pt 14pt 0pt;">It's important to note here that William's single-minded focus at the time was on double stars and not nebulae. In fact, until their&nbsp;move to Datchet, and until Caroline had&nbsp;begun her comet sweeps, William had seen&nbsp;only four nebulae.</p>
<p class="font5" style="text-align:justify;">CAROLINE'S TREASURES</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;padding:0pt 0pt 7pt 0pt;">When Caroline first started sweeping the night sky, she “knew too little of the real&nbsp;heavens to be able to point out every object&nbsp;so as to findit again without losing too much&nbsp;time by consulting the Atlas.” This was most&nbsp;disturbing when her brother was away: “I&nbsp;was, of course, left solely to amuse myself</p></td>

But all these troubles were&nbsp;removed when I knew my brother to be at no&nbsp;great distance makingobservationswith his&nbsp;various instruments on double stars, planets, etc., and I could have his assistance&nbsp;immediately when I found a nebula or cluster of stars, of which I intended to give a catalogue.”</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;padding:0pt 0pt 7pt 0pt;">Caroline's “finds” were relatively few at first. On her first night of observing (August&nbsp;22, 1782) she found one of William's double stars. Then, on September 30, she</p></td></tr></table><hr>

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;">encountered a few more double stars and her first comet masquerader – the 27th&nbsp;object in Messier's list. By October she had&nbsp;added M36 and M13 to her repertoire. By&nbsp;January 23, 1783, she was clearly beginning&nbsp;to enjoy her time with the stars, for on that&nbsp;night she had spent 30 minutes looking at&nbsp;M44, noting that she did not find any “nebulas” in or around it, just distinct stars.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:9pt;padding:0pt 0pt 10pt 0pt;">It was on the evening of February 26, 1783, that Caroline's luck changed. On that&nbsp;night she recorded a nebula not recorded in&nbsp;Messier's list, and showed it to her brother.&nbsp;The object, known today as open cluster&nbsp;NGC 2360 (Caldwell 58), was the first of&nbsp;14 deep-sky objects she would discover or&nbsp;independently discover, 11 of which had&nbsp;never before been seen by humans. The&nbsp;identity of some of these objects have mystified modern astronomers, prompting much&nbsp;controversy over which objects truly exist&nbsp;and which truly belong to Caroline and&nbsp;not her brother. The matter has been satisfactorily cleared up by astronomical historian Michael Hoskin in the November&nbsp;2005 <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Journal for the History of Astronomy&nbsp;</span><span class="font19">(Churchill College, Cambridge, UK). A list of&nbsp;each of Caroline's discoveries, adapted with&nbsp;permission from Hoskin's article, appears&nbsp;in chronological order below.

While faint, NGC 189&nbsp;is 0.5-magnitude brighter and more condensed than NGC 381, giving it a greater&nbsp;surface brightness of 12.3. Also, NGC 189 is&nbsp;near Dolidze 12, a slight concentration of&nbsp;Milky Way adding to the region's dynam-icism, especially in a rich-field telescope,&nbsp;which Caroline used. Hoskin's discovery of&nbsp;Caroline's original journal entry clearly dismisses NGC 381 as being one of Caroline's&nbsp;discoveries.</p>

<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:9pt;padding:0pt 0pt 11pt 0pt;">Hoskin notes that several deep-sky objects have also been erroneously&nbsp;attributed to Caroline. A clerical error&nbsp;by Caroline's hand, erroneously attributes&nbsp;V.19 (NGC 891 [Caldwell 23], a 10th-magnitude edge-on galaxy in Andromeda)&nbsp;to her, and on March 4, 1783, Caroline&nbsp;recorded that she found a “very obscure”&nbsp;nebula near 19 Monocerotis, William wrote:&nbsp;“Lina near 19 Monocerotis very obscure.”&nbsp;Either this observation is very confused or&nbsp;Caroline had found an unclaimed comet.&nbsp;Hoskin explains the confusion:</p>
<p class="font18" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:1pt;padding:0pt 0pt 11pt 9pt;">William credits Caroline with first sighting of the cluster VII.27, seen by him in sweep 529 on&nbsp;24 Feb 1786, immediately after he had viewed&nbsp;M50. The position he gives for M50 in his sweep&nbsp;record is 6<sup>h</sup>53<sup>m</sup>11<sup>s</sup>, –8<span class="font1"><sup>◦</sup> </span><span class="font18">6</span><span class="font1"><sup>^</sup> </span><span class="font18">, and the position for&nbsp;VII.27, 7<sup>h</sup>1<sup>m</sup>17<sup>s</sup>,–8</span><span class="font1"><sup>◦</sup> </span><span class="font18">16</span><span class="font1"><sup>^</sup></span><span class="font18">. VII.27 was therefore&nbsp;some 8<sup>m</sup> following M50 and slightly south of&nbsp;it, whereas 19 Mon was nearly 4</span><span class="font1"><sup>◦</sup> </span><span class="font18">north of M50.&nbsp;Therefore, whatever it was that Caroline saw in&nbsp;1783, it was not VII.27.</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;">Although there is no deep-sky object in the position of Herschel's VII.27, there is a&nbsp;“very obscure” deep-sky object a little more&nbsp;than 1<span class="font2"><sup>◦</sup> </span><span class="font19">west and slightly south of 19 Mono-cerotis – NGC 2311, a 9th-magnitude open&nbsp;cluster that William discovered on November 26, 1786, and cataloged as VIII.60. But&nbsp;this object would have been much too faint&nbsp;for Caroline to see in her small refractor&nbsp;(her reflector had not yet been completed).&nbsp;O'Meara notes that even with a modern 4-inch telescope at 23</span><span class="font5">× </span><span class="font19">under adark sky, NGC&nbsp;2311 is visible only if one knows where to&nbsp;look with averted vision. It's possible then&nbsp;that Caroline had either seen (and missed)&nbsp;her first comet, or picked up a small splash&nbsp;of stars in this Milky Way region – perhaps even the roughly 12</span><span class="font2"><sup>^</sup> </span><span class="font19">-wide arc of four&nbsp;8th-magnitude stars immediately east of&nbsp;NGC 2311.</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;padding:0pt 0pt 11pt 0pt;">The latter hypothesis is not far-fetched. Several mysterious observations appear&nbsp;in Caroline's journals, mostly of nebulous stars. For instance, on the evening of</p></td></tr></table><hr>

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;">October 13, 1783, she recorded that “chi Aur or near it is nebulous.” Most likely, the&nbsp;budding observer was recording the fuzzy&nbsp;appearance of Chi Aurigae and its close&nbsp;attendant stars. She made a similar observation while sweeping through Cetus on&nbsp;December 1, 1783, seeing some faint stars&nbsp;“which I cannot help thinking make a nebulous appearance.” It's important to note&nbsp;that at times Caroline suffered the fate of&nbsp;manymodernobserverswhenhertelescope&nbsp;dewed over so fast she could not record the&nbsp;locations of her finds. It is possible then,&nbsp;that some of the “nebulosity” the blossom-ingobserversuspectedwascaused by moisture collecting on the objective or eyepiece.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">One of these “mysterious” observations may not be all that mysterious after all.&nbsp;On July 30, 1783, Caroline recorded the following observation: “In the neck of Equuleus or head of Aquarius, a rich spot&nbsp;near 3, 4, 7 Equ.” The star 7 Equ is not&nbsp;near 3 and 4 Equulei, but if one ignores&nbsp;the reference to 7 Equ, there is a remarkable asterism approximately 54<span class="font2"><sup>^</sup> </span><span class="font19">northeast&nbsp;of 4 Equ documented in Archinal and&nbsp;Hynes's book </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Star Clusters.</span><span class="font19"> David Levy and&nbsp;Wendee Wallach-Levy found it in December 2000 and call it the Equuleus S owing&nbsp;to its location and S-shaped appearance –&nbsp;a sinuous, 22</span><span class="font2"><sup>^</sup> </span><span class="font19">-wide, S-shaped stream of&nbsp;some 25 stars of 9th magnitude and fainter&nbsp;suns that extend in an east–west direction (right ascension 21</span><span class="font17"><sup>h</sup> </span><span class="font19">08.8</span><span class="font17"><sup>m</sup></span><span class="font19">; declination </span><span class="font5">+</span><span class="font19">06</span><span class="font2"><sup>◦</sup> </span><span class="font19">20</span><span class="font2"><sup>^</sup> </span><span class="font19">; epoch 2000). With an eyepiece overlay of 2</span><span class="font2"><sup>◦</sup> </span><span class="font19">, I found that both 3&nbsp;and 4 Equulei and the Equuleus S would&nbsp;be in the same eyepiece that Caroline used&nbsp;for sweeping. Seen at low power, the Equuleus S could be her “rich spot,” as she was&nbsp;using a new telescope with a deeper limiting&nbsp;magnitude.</span></p></td>
<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:9pt;">O'Meara also believes it's possible that Caroline confused the two horses (Pegasus and Equuleus), since 3, 4, and 7 Pegasi&nbsp;(which are grouped together) lie only about&nbsp;4 fields east and slightly north of 3 and 4&nbsp;Equulei, near the head of Aquarius. He notes&nbsp;that when Caroline made her discovery, she&nbsp;was only just learning how to use her new&nbsp;sweeper, which gave her wider vistas and&nbsp;more stars to see, so any grouping of stars in&nbsp;this sparsely populated region would have&nbsp;given her reason to pause and reflect.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:9pt;">Regardless of these understandable observations, Caroline's penchant for discovery did not go unnoticed. In remarking&nbsp;about her discovery of NGC 7789, Adm.&nbsp;William H. Smyth, an admirer of Caroline's&nbsp;career, states in his <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Bedford Catalogue</span><span class="font19"> that&nbsp;this discovery “would alone justify Miss&nbsp;Herschel's nomination [for tribute.]”</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:9pt;padding:0pt 0pt 18pt 0pt;">Equally important is the inescapable contention that Caroline's rash of deep-sky discoveries are what prompted William to turn his attention away from double star observing and to start his greatest endeavor – a&nbsp;systematic search for nebulae with his large&nbsp;20-foot telescope, which began shortly after&nbsp;Caroline made her 12th deep-sky discovery&nbsp;on October 30, 1783. As Caroline recalled,&nbsp;“In the beginning of December [1783] I&nbsp;became entirely attached to the writingdesk, and had seldom an opportunity after&nbsp;that time of using my newly acquired instrument.” William was certainly eager to start&nbsp;his own hunt for deep-sky objects, as Caroline recalls:</p>
<p class="font18" style="text-align:justify;padding:0pt 0pt 9pt 9pt;">My brother began his series of sweeps when the instrument was yet in a very unfinished&nbsp;state, and my feelings were not very comfortable when every moment I was alarmed by&nbsp;a crack or fall, knowing him to be elevated</p></td></tr></table><hr>

<p class="font18" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:8pt;padding:0pt 0pt 8pt 9pt;">That my fears of danger and accidents were not wholly imaginary, I had an unlucky proof&nbsp;on the night of the 31st December. The evening&nbsp;had been cloudy, but about ten o'clock a few&nbsp;stars became visible, and in the greatest hurry&nbsp;all was got ready for observing. My brother, at&nbsp;the front of the telescope, directed me to make&nbsp;some alteration in the lateral motion, which&nbsp;was done by machinery, on which the point of&nbsp;support of the tube and mirror rested. At each&nbsp;end of the machine or trough was an iron hook,&nbsp;such as butchers use for hanging their joints&nbsp;upon, and having to run in the dark on ground&nbsp;covered a foot deep with melting snow, I fell&nbsp;on one of those hooks, which entered my right&nbsp;leg above the knee. My brother's call, “Make&nbsp;haste” I could only answer by a pitiful cry, “I&nbsp;am hooked.”</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;padding:0pt 0pt 15pt 0pt;">A new fire was raging in William, and Caroline, with her noble discoveries, undoubtedly sparked it. Yet Caroline did not give up on her desire to discover.

It has been raining all&nbsp;day, and she is worried that the skies will not&nbsp;clear. She spends the day calculating 150 nebulae discovered by her brother, who was away&nbsp;on a trip, but her mind is on the object she saw&nbsp;last evening at 10 p.m. – an object “very much&nbsp;resembling in color and brightness the 27 nebula of the </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">Connaissance des Temps</span><span class="font18"> [M27], with&nbsp;the difference, however of being round.

<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font18" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:8pt;padding:0pt 0pt 13pt 9pt;">Caroline's hopes rise as the sky clears in the afternoon. After sundown she sets up her&nbsp;4.2-inch reflector and refinds the field. Suddenly she spies the object, which looks “like&nbsp;an out of focus star,” and notices that it has&nbsp;moved. The night before the object had made&nbsp;a perfect isosceles triangle with two stars, but&nbsp;no longer. Taking up her pen, she redraws the&nbsp;field and plots the motion in relation to the two&nbsp;stars. By 1:00 a.m. she has followed her object&nbsp;long enough to declare that it is a comet. Rather&nbsp;than sleep, she writes a letter to Alex Aubert and&nbsp;describes the discovery. In that letter, the modest woman apologizes, saying, “I hope, sir, you&nbsp;will excuse the trouble I give you with my wag&nbsp;[meaning, vague] description, which is owing&nbsp;tomybeingabad(orwhatisbetter)noobserver&nbsp;at all . . . Lastly, I beg of you, sir, if this comet&nbsp;should not have been seen before, to take it&nbsp;under your protection.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:9pt;">What an exciting time it must have been for this first lady of comet hunters. She&nbsp;was also surrounded by friends who wished&nbsp;her well. In a letter dated August 7, 1786,&nbsp;Aubert writes to her, “I wish you joy, most&nbsp;sincerely, on the discovery. I am more&nbsp;pleased than you can well conceive that&nbsp;you have made it, and I think I see your&nbsp;<span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">wonderfully clever</span><span class="font19"> and </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">wonderfully amiable&nbsp;</span><span class="font19">brother, upon the news of it, shed a tear of&nbsp;joy.”</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:9pt;padding:0pt 0pt 6pt 0pt;">Comet hunting was quite unusual for a woman of the 1800s. In fact, it was unprecedented. Yet this is what Caroline loved&nbsp;the most; to this day her comet finds are</p><div style="float:left;layout-flow:horizontal;"><img src="Hidden Treasures_files/Hidden Treasures-497.jpg" style="width:255pt;height:414pt;"/></div>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;">considered her most important astronomical contributions, though this is very subjective. And it was the 10 years from 1788 to 1798, that she enjoyed the&nbsp;most fruitful period of astronomical discovery, for during&nbsp;that time she had discovered&nbsp;seven more comets.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Interestingly, in 1788, William married Mary Pitt,&nbsp;daughter of a wealthy merchant and a widow of John&nbsp;Pitt, Esq., whose first child&nbsp;had died. Mary later gave&nbsp;birth to William's only child,&nbsp;John Herschel, who later&nbsp;continued his father's investigations of the heavens and&nbsp;was adored by Caroline.&nbsp;Although Caroline continued&nbsp;to work as William's assistant,&nbsp;she also began to strike out&nbsp;on her own. Her independence blossomed further on&nbsp;December 21, seven months&nbsp;after her brother's marriage&nbsp;at age 49, when she discovered her second comet,&nbsp;35P/1788 Y1 a little more&nbsp;than 1<span class="font2"><sup>◦</sup> </span><span class="font19">southwest of Beta&nbsp;Lyrae. Her brother called it a&nbsp;“pretty visible object,” noting&nbsp;that it was slow moving and&nbsp;much larger than M57. At the&nbsp;time of discovery, Caroline&nbsp;was searching for the return&nbsp;of the Great Comet of 1661, which was speculated upon by Halley as being possibly&nbsp;identical with the Comet of 1532.<a name="footnote14"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark254">14</a></sup></span><span class="font17"><sup></sup></span></p></td></tr></table><hr>

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:9pt;padding:0pt 0pt 10pt 0pt;">William described the circumstances of the discovery to the Earl of Salisbury,&nbsp;Hertfordshire:</p>
<p class="font18" style="text-align:justify;padding:0pt 0pt 0pt 9pt;">My Lord, the Great Comet (Comet of 1661) which is expected has not yet made its appearance but we are in hopes every day to meet&nbsp;with it. Your Lordship will find the small comet&nbsp;whichwe are now observing,whichwasdiscov-ered by my sister the 21st Dec when she was on&nbsp;the lookout for the expected one in the Constellation of the Lyre, and the enclosed figure&nbsp;will point it out. Etc....</p>
<p class="font18" style="text-align:justify;padding:0pt 0pt 10pt 58pt;">Wm Herschel Slough, Jan 8, 1789.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;padding:0pt 0pt 10pt 0pt;">WilliamalsowrotetoSirHarry Englefield, as Englefield had once pointed out a comet to&nbsp;William that Messier had found. Englefield&nbsp;replied on Christmas Day 1788:</p>
<p class="font18" style="text-align:justify;padding:0pt 0pt 10pt 9pt;">I am much obliged to you for your account of the Comet and beg you to make my complements to Miss Herschel on her discovery.&nbsp;She will soon be the great Comet finder and&nbsp;bear away the Prize from Messieurs Messier&nbsp;and Mechain.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;">Caroline's reputation was soaring. She was being congratulated, recognized, and compared to other great astronomers of her day –&nbsp;ones who had gained great reputations as&nbsp;comet hunters and discoverers.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:9pt;">Caroline discovered two of the three comets found in 1790: C/1790 A1 on January 7 and C/1790 H1 on April 17. Charles&nbsp;Messier observed C/1790 A1 on January 19,&nbsp;describing its appearance as nebulous with&nbsp;a bright condensation; he likened its brightness to the globular cluster M15 in Pegasus.&nbsp;The comet was last seen only two nights&nbsp;later. At discovery, C/1790 H1 was a small,&nbsp;faint object in Andromeda, without a tail.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:9pt;padding:0pt 0pt 13pt 0pt;">It's a compliment to Caroline that she found this comet, given the circumstances,&nbsp;which she describes in a letter to Alexander&nbsp;Aubert dated April 18, 1790:</p></td>
<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font18" style="text-align:justify;padding:0pt 0pt 13pt 9pt;">I am almost ashamed to write to you, because I never think of doing so but when I am in distress. I found last night at 16h 24<span class="font1"><sup>^</sup> </span><span class="font18">sidereal time&nbsp;a comet, and do not know what to do with it, for&nbsp;my sweeper is not half finished; and besides I&nbsp;broke the handle of the perpendicular motion&nbsp;in my brother's absence (who is on a little tour&nbsp;into Yorkshire) . . . All my hopes were that I&nbsp;should not find anything which would make&nbsp;me feel the want of these things in his absence;&nbsp;but, as it happens, here is an object in a place&nbsp;where there is no nebula, or anything which&nbsp;could look like a comet.</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;">Aubert spied the suspect, which he called “<span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">something faint</span><span class="font19">,” on the morning of January 21. His happiness for Caroline is&nbsp;certain: “You cannot, my dear Miss Herschel, judge the pleasure I feel when your&nbsp;reputation and fame increase; everyone&nbsp;must admire your and your brother's knowledge, industry, and behaviour. God grant&nbsp;you many years of health and happiness.”&nbsp;By early May, Caroline's comet had grown&nbsp;in brightness and was slightly fainter than&nbsp;M31; it also had the beginnings of a tail.&nbsp;Indeed, by May 20, the tail had grown to 4</span><span class="font2"><sup>◦</sup> </span><span class="font19">in&nbsp;length. On May 28, Caroline wrote, “I saw the&nbsp;comet thro' the clouds, when I could not see&nbsp;a single star in the heavens, with the naked&nbsp;eye.” The comet was last seen on June 29.</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:9pt;padding:0pt 0pt 13pt 0pt;">Caroline's fifth comet, C/1791 X1, was the only comet discovered in 1791.

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;">know them. Caroline simply described the object as a “pretty large, telescopic comet.”&nbsp;But her brother, William noted that it was&nbsp;6 arcminutes in diameter with a central&nbsp;condensation 5 or 6 arcseconds across. He&nbsp;also recorded a faint, ill-defined ray extending nearly 15 arcminutes to the north. The&nbsp;comet slowly faded from view and was last&nbsp;seen by Messier on January 28.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:9pt;">Caroline found her sixth comet on October 7, 1793, near Delta (<span class="font5">^</span><span class="font19">) Ophiuchi. Charles Messier, however, had found it 10 days&nbsp;earlier. And though the comet is officially&nbsp;known as C/1793 S2 (Messier), Caroline is&nbsp;credited as an independent discoverer in&nbsp;cometographies.</span></p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:9pt;padding:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">A little more than two years passed before Caroline made another comet find. She&nbsp;announcedherseventhdiscoveryinamod-est letter to Sir Joseph Banks, dated November 8, 1795:</p>
<p class="font18" style="text-align:justify;padding:0pt 0pt 12pt 9pt;">Last night in sweeping over a part of the heavens with my five-foot reflector, I met with a telescopic comet . . . It will probably pass between the head of the Swan and the constellation&nbsp;of the Lyre, in its descent towards the sun.&nbsp;The direction of its motion is retrograde . . .&nbsp;As the appearance of one of these objects is&nbsp;almost become a novelty, I flatter myself that&nbsp;this intelligence will not be uninteresting to&nbsp;astronomers, and therefore hope, sir, you will,&nbsp;with your usual kindness, recommend it to&nbsp;their notice.</p></td>
<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;">Indeed, this was a great discovery. The comet was seen for 23 days, with carefully&nbsp;measured positions obtained. But mathematicians struggled with determining its&nbsp;orbit, trying to fit a parabolic, rather than&nbsp;an elliptical orbit, and subsequently it was&nbsp;lost. This comet is now popularly known&nbsp;as Encke's comet, for the German mathematician Johann F. Encke who firmly established its periodicity and predicted its 3.3year return to Earth's vicinity. Indeed, Caro-line'sdiscoveryofEncke'scomet(2P/Encke)&nbsp;was the second known observed return to&nbsp;perihelion of this comet. (Pierre Mechain&nbsp;first discovered it on January 17, 1786,&nbsp;while sweeping for comets in the Aquarius&nbsp;region.) Comet 2P/Encke is still the comet&nbsp;with the shortest known orbital period.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:9pt;padding:0pt 0pt 10pt 0pt;">Caroline's last discovery, C/1797 P1/ Bouvard-Herschel, was the only comet discovered in 1797. She discovered it with her&nbsp;naked eye on August 14, almost at the same&nbsp;time as Eugene Brouvard (Paris). She must&nbsp;have known it would be found soon by others, for Caroline climbed onto a horse to&nbsp;deliver her letter of discovery to Dr. Maske-lyne herself, as she explains in a letter dated&nbsp;August 17, 1797, to Joseph Banks:</p>
<p class="font18" style="text-align:justify;padding:0pt 0pt 10pt 9pt;">I have so little faith in the expedition of messengers of all descriptions that I undertook to bemyown...butunfortunately I undertook&nbsp;the task with only the preparation ofone hour's&nbsp;sleep, and having in the course of five years&nbsp;neverrodeabove twomilesat atime,thetwenty&nbsp;to London, and the idea of six or seven more to&nbsp;Greenwich in reserve, totally unfitted me for&nbsp;any action.</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;padding:0pt 0pt 10pt 0pt;">Caroline's account of the discovery of her eighth and last comet closes the discovery&nbsp;period of her life:</p>

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;padding:0pt 0pt 8pt 0pt;">After Caroline left the cottage she was living in, and moved to temporary lodgings in October 1797, she gave up her practice&nbsp;of regular sweepings for comets.

This comet must have been&nbsp;the Great Comet of 1807, which was discovered on September 19 of that year and&nbsp;was still 1st or 2nd magnitude in October.&nbsp;And in September 1811, she made some&nbsp;lengthy observations of a comet of which&nbsp;her friend Mr. Pigot had given her notice.&nbsp;She described it as having:</p>
<p class="font18" style="text-align:justify;padding:0pt 0pt 7pt 9pt;">a nucleus of white light, which appeared to me equal in size to 47 Ursae (which is of reddish light); then to the nucleus adhered a circular white nebulosity, which I estimate about&nbsp;3 times the breadth of the nucleus.</p>

<p class="font5" style="text-align:justify;">CAROLINE THE INDEFATIGABLE</p>
<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;">Besides her regular daily chores, Caroline, at the request of her brother, undertook&nbsp;the enormous task of indexing and cross&nbsp;referencing Flamsteed's <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Observations of the&nbsp;Fixed Stars,</span><span class="font19"> along with a list of 560 stars that&nbsp;were not included in the original catalog.

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:9pt;">William's health was failing by 1819. In a feeble hand, on a yellow slip of paper&nbsp;William wrote: “LINA, There is a great&nbsp;comet.” The Great Comet of 1819 (Comet&nbsp;Tralles) ascended above the northwest horizon as a conspicuous naked-eye object in&nbsp;Europe in the first days of July with an 8<span class="font2"><sup>◦</sup> </span><span class="font19">-long tail. The earliest observation of its position was made by Professor Tralles of Berlin&nbsp;on July 1. The comet transited the Sun a&nbsp;few days earlier. Possible observations of the&nbsp;transit by Pastoroff were presented by none&nbsp;other than William's son John Herschel to&nbsp;the Royal Society many years later.</span></p>

Caroline&nbsp;explained to her nephew John Herschel that&nbsp;“If you see an “L” and find a cluster of&nbsp;stars thereabout, I shall claim it as one of&nbsp;those I mentioned in my last letter.” The&nbsp;unpublished manuscript (the <span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Zone Catalogue)</span><span class="font19">, was mailed to John who was continuing his father's work on the nebulae.&nbsp;The </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Zone Catalogue</span><span class="font19"> was of immeasurable&nbsp;assistance to John in completing the </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">General Catalogue of Nebulae</span><span class="font19"> published in 1863.&nbsp;In the introduction to his </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">General Catalogue&nbsp;</span><span class="font19">John honored her astounding contribution:&nbsp;“I learned fully to appreciate the skill, diligence, and accuracy which that indefatigable lady brought to bearona task which only&nbsp;the most boundless devotion could have&nbsp;induced her to undertake or enabled her&nbsp;to accomplish.” For this crucial contribution to astronomy she was awarded the Gold&nbsp;Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society of&nbsp;London on February 8, 1828.</span></p>

<p class="font19" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:9pt;">Living to age 97, her mental faculties intact, Caroline was indeed a remarkably&nbsp;accomplished astronomer. The sheer scale&nbsp;of her contributions to astronomy are&nbsp;exhausting. Dedicated to her brother and&nbsp;her work, Caroline would walk to and from&nbsp;her brother's observatory through his own&nbsp;grounds – a distance quite half a mile, which&nbsp;musthavebeentryinginbadweather.There&nbsp;is a tradition in Slough that the son of the&nbsp;owner of one of the houses where she lodged&nbsp;for a short time, in the High Street, would&nbsp;tell how, when a boy, he used sometimes&nbsp;to be roused in the night by her rap on the&nbsp;wall, when the weather, which had at first&nbsp;been cloudy, cleared up. Knowing the signal, he would get up, light a lantern, and&nbsp;going downstairs find her ready dressed and&nbsp;awaiting him.

Over the next two years, the tube was recrafted to the original specifications, despite the lack of drawings and the&nbsp;sparsity of the Third Earl's notes. Much of the credit for rescuing William Parson's original vision from the mists of history&nbsp;must lie with a handful of people: people like Michael Tubridy, the Project Engineer, Owen McCarthy and his team, who&nbsp;took care of design considerations, and Bridget Roden, Project Manager. The patronage of various prominent Irish&nbsp;business people, as well as the support of several Irish government agencies, in addition to European financial aid,&nbsp;allowed the present Earl's vision to become a reality. As Fred Watson writes in his 2004 book </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Stargazer: The Life and Times&nbsp;of the Telescope,</span><span class="font18"> the telescope now has a new aluminum mirror and modern hydraulic mechanisms to move it. “Thanks to&nbsp;the vision and energy of William Brendan Parsons, Seventh Earl of Rosse, the telescope now represents an exciting fusion&nbsp;of old and new technology, a shining example of the best of both worlds.”</span></p>

Just after entering Go¨ ttingen University as a student of astronomy in December 1853, Winnecke discovered NGC 6791, an open cluster in Lyra, with his 3-inch refractor. He would also go on to&nbsp;discover his first of 10 comets on December 22, 1854. All told, Winnecke would discover nine new nebulae, including&nbsp;NGC 1398 (Hidden Treasure 19).</span></p>

Raymundo of Brazil. The comet's modern designation&nbsp;is 153P/2002 C1 (Ikeya-Zhang). Interestingly, on July 28, 1939, Roger Rigollet of France discovered an 8th-magnitude&nbsp;comet that L. E. Cunningham found to be identical with Caroline's comet of 1788. This periodic comet is now known as&nbsp;35P/Herschel-Rigollet.</span></p>
